Hritim studying online through mobile.
HRITIM (O.S.)

MR. SRIJAN

MR. SRIJAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)

HRITIM
Papa..
MR. SRIJAN
Banoge , jaroor banoge. Bhai sahab
vaise apka naam nahi poochha, kya
naam hai?
Red light starting glowing , aeroplane crashed. The back of
aero plane blown away. The back people were flown away due to
pressure. Every other at front held seat tightly . The pilot
calling call center to start rescue operation. Some one
pickup the call , then no response.
MR.ANEK
It can't be , it can't be......
MR.ANEK (LOOKING AT HIS BARE
WRIST) (CONT'D)
rrivirr... , send me pods at my
coordinates.
3.
RRIVIRR (O.S.)
Sorry, it would take 3 minutes and
38 seconds.....
Anek knew that it was impossible for rrivirr to reach there
in time although it has speed more that 9000KM/Hr .There is
turmoil and every one is afraid , plane is rotating and
falling down. Anek converted his bag into parachute(it was
very advanced bag). But it can safely handle only two person.
So he decided to save those 2 boys by fastening them into
parachute and throwing them outside . So Both of them asked
there sons to keep calm . They kept hugging there children 3-
4 time, knowing that It is the last time they are meeting
there sons. Both fathers were weeping with smiling face to
give comfort to there children . Both hritim and rohan were
saying no, nooo,no..... . Anek threw both of them from
backside of broken plane. A broken piece of aeroplane teared
rohan's hand and a small injury in rohan's hand , but Anek
also fell down due to pressure , shouting loud that you both
should leave together piecefully. Srijan seeing his son last
time with little smile from the plane and then whole plane
was blasted.
EXT. GROUND- NOON
Hritim sobbying for his father and Rohan's face was bit
nervous. Rohan was bit emotionall and was staring toward the
sky for about 2 minutes. Later on he was trying to console
Hritim. Since plane was crashed around 1.5km ahead ,there
were no person to help them. All of them were at site of
plane's debris.
It's been 5 hour , Hritim is sobying for his father alone in
a vast ground and no other people were there to help them.
ROHAN
Chal uth bhai , chal kahi kuchh
kha lete hai. mere paas 200 rupye
hai. Ye mandir me dene ke liye tha
mere papa ne diya tha, par maa ko
mere papa ka khoon chahiye tha.
(wiping tears in eyes)
HRITIM
Papa ,Papa......
Hritim got unconsious , then rohan picks him on his shoulder
and moved toward incoming light of city. He goes around 1 km
like this , then Hritim came in conscious.
4.
HRITIM (CONT'D)
Mujhe mere papa ke paas jaana hai,
le chalo mujhe ...
ROHAN
Tere papa nahi rahe , chal mai
tujhe pahle paani pilata hu... .
Rohan went to city and asked for water at a shop.It was
evening. A box came at him automatically giving him a bottle
of water and in return, it tried to accomplish payment
automatically (due to advancement in system). But since Rohan
do not have any such gadgets he have to pay 80 rupees
manually.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Hritim , le pi le ...
lo .....
Hritim drinks all the water . Rohan was also thursty but he
didn't drink as he did not have much money. Rohan then asks
for some fast food items for Hritim, and he was asked to pay
220 rupees . He has only 120 of them so he asked food stall
keeper to remove some of the items. Then he gave major of
food to Hritim and ate some of them himself. Meanwhile on big
news board screen , the news was there that an aeroplane
crashed and no one survived.
Now night came off, they have to sleep but they weren't
getting any place to sleep. After asking for some house and
getting rejected they at last decided to sleep in the same
ground where they crashed off from plane.
It was month of february,It wasn't so chilling winter but
weather was cold. They didn't have any blanket .
HRITIM
Wo bag kaha hai,
ROHAN
Baaaig...
HRITIM
Ha, vo parachute, usi ko odh ke so
jaate hai
ROHAN
Vo to wahi chhod diye the, yahi
kahi pada hoga.... ruk jao mai
laata hu. andhera hai lekin mil
jayega .... .
They slept there with parachute over them.
5.
EXT. GROUND- MORNING
Hritim woke up early morning as of his habit for his studies
but soon he realized that situation are not same . He was
analyzing the situation of plane crash , he then thought of
the voice of his father "It cant be, it can't be". Again he
thought of flashback when his father while teaching him about
phyics.
INT. ROOM- MORNING
HRITIM
How FastCopters flies in the air,
why gravity doesn't pulls it down.
ANEK
Beta ,gravity pull karti hai par
plane ke wings usko upar thrust
deti hai, so it balances out.
HRITIM
What if two Fastcopters colloid.
ANEK
Fastcopters hamesha se nahi hote
the, pahle aeroplanes , airships
helicopter hua karte the. They all
have well defined path.
Aaj be aeroplanes hote hai par
thode advanced ho gaye hai aur
helicopters ab fastcopters me badal
gaye hai.
HRITIM
No , what if somehow they colloid.
ANEK
(smiling)
Technology is so advanced that no
air accidents occurs. The last
serious air accident occured was in
2114, aur uske baad aaj tak koi
accident nahi hua hai. And It never
would occur again.
HRITIM
What if it occurs
ANEK
It can only happen when the owner
or pilot of copter wants it or in
situation of strong bad luck.
6.
EXT. GROUND- MORNING
Hritim doing exercises/meditation learned from his father. He
was trying to get over his thought from his father . After
1/2 hrs Rohan woke up.
ROHAN
Chalo kahi shahar chalte hai ,
mujhe bhookh lagi hai.
HRITIM
Paisa nahi hai, to kaise khayenge .
ROHAN
Chalo kisi se maang lenge.
HRITIM
Ye, urban area... ,yaha kisse
magenge . Yaha koi madad nahi karne
wala.
ROHAN
chalo dekhte hai.
They ,in search of food went to many homes but were pushed
out by automated system or house owners. They saw beside on
holographic road news board that the head of Pathpro
aeroplanes airport from where the aeroplane was taken off
was arrested for 10 years . The Hritim stopped and is
watching his 3d hologram. He was shouting "maine kuchh nahi
kiya" to the AI Judging system";
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Accha hua...
HRITIM
Usko itne saalo ka saja kyo mila?.
Agar ye proved nahi hai ki usne hi
plane crash karwaya , to maximum 2
month ka saja hona chahiye , par 10
saal.... Matter kuchh aur hai. Koi
apna hi nuksaan kyo karna chahega
crash karwa ke. Later on on news
board it was said that head's name
was Ajit.
Further news board was showing that the share prices of
Pathpro aeroplanes fell down abruptlessly. Hritim and rohan
were asking help in shops , homes everywhere but no help ...
They returned to the same ground at last with empty stomach.
They tried to sleep but could not due to hunger. It's been 1
and half day for Rohan to not have eaten food.
7.
EXT. GROUND- MIDNIGHT
Hritim was sleeping but rohan due to hunger cannot. He saw
that some men were going toward other side of city from there
work.
ROHAN
Hritim , Hritim , ...utho ,
.................utho yarr
HRITIM
Ha kya hua,
ROHAN
Chalo yaar us taraf chalte hai,
kyoki maine dekha ki kuchhh log
udhar ja rahe , shayad kuchh khane
ko mil jaye, mujhe bahut bhook lagi
hai.
They went to the rural side. The village was very poor . All
men goes toward city for livelihood and some of them even
don't have jobs . Hritim and Rohan asked for food in the
first house. The family has two members only mum and son.
Son's name was Suraj. Her mom was giving food of 2 chapattis
and some vegetables to him. Her mother decided to give them
all food to Hritim and Rohan. As soon as she give they all
ate it, and asked for more.
SURAJ'S MOM
Ab mere paas nahi hai. 2 roti tha
jo maine bete ke liye banaya tha vo
maine tum logo ko de diya.
HRITIM
Aap log aise hi roj jeete ho.
ROHAN
Tumko kya laga? Ab middle class
family jaisa kuchh nahi hai, ya to
tum bahut amir ho ya to bahut
gareeb.
SURAJ'S MOM
Suraj ke papa ek backery shop pe
kaam karte the. Fir owner ne unke
jagah pe ek Alton noyce ka robot
rakh liya. Fir koi kaam na milne ki
wajah se vo mentally depressed ho
gaye aur unka dehaant ho gaya.
HRITIM
Hospital me nahi le gaye ?
8.
SURAJ'S MOM
Gaye the sarkari hospital me, free
ka ilaaj to hota hai, par doctor's
privately dekhte hai apne clinic
par ,aur consultancy fees 1500 ka
hai. Beta ham afford nahi sakte
utna.
ROHAN
Ye AI , robots jabse aaye hai saari
naukriya kha gaye hai. Mera chale
to mai in sab ko khatm kar doo.
HRITIM
"A plus sign is made with 2
negative sign".
Technology which improved the
livelihood of someone , worsened
that of other.
ROHAN
Chalo chalte hai......
They got out of house in search of there livelihood . But no
major help they were getting from rural side . They passed
times beside roads like many others looking for help.
After some time , there comes a car with 3 family members in
it. It has mother, father and a son. Son also has a robotic
toy of a knight ,which talks like if it was real knight in
intelligent way.
BOY
(looking at his father)
Hey doctor, why're these ..
MOM
Hmmmmmn, Boby say sorry to Dad
BOY
Why're these dirty fellows standi'n
here evryd'y.
DAD
(laughing looking at poors
standing beside)
They don't want to work . Just want
to get filled with the earnings of
our hard work.
MOM
It's not like that, ve bas majboor
hai.
9.
BOBY
Sah, they're not dirty, they're
just leavi'n dog life. Right dad ?
DAD
Yes my son. If any one comes like
this in my hospital , I just don't
come near. My Compounders are
trained to tackle with them. They
just torture's them more so they
won't come. You know they are
unemotional AI's.
BOBY
(laughing hard)
DAD
come down boby.
BOBY
Nah, I'll be he're in the car . I
have my snacks and square Butter .
I won't go to restaurant.
DAD
Okay, be there...
BOBY
I hate my mother , she dont' allow
me to play Round corner-v9 game in
cell phone.
TOY
That bitch...
Let's play... until they come.
Bob takes out the mobile phone stealthily which he was hiding
from his parents.
Toy( an AI) and boby were playing that game. The game was
played into 3d space with holography. It was 2 player game .
Suraj's mom was also standing there on the road side . She
came to the car.
SURAJ'S MOM
Beta , mere bete ko kuchh khane ko
de do.
BOBY
Eh, don't distu'b , and go away.
Very bad smell.. Just go away.
10.
SURAJ
Please de do, bahut bhook lagi hai.
Boby and toy were laughing at him. He them came out of car,
Crushed the square butter with his leg into land, and gave it
to suraj.
Suraj took it and starting eating as he was hungry. Rohan was
seeing all this. He came near car while suraj was eating the
dirty butter.
Rohan came angrily and broke the Toy and thrown onto the face
of Boby. The Boby with tears in his eye came to fight with
Rohan but rohan beat him so much and gave 3 slaps.
ROHAN
Suraj, car me se saare khane uthao
aur bhaag jao,
Suraj's mom left the hand she was holding of his son. It was
indication that Suraj should do it. Finding a good
opportunity Suraj did like that. While Suraj was taking out
all the foods, Rohan snatched his mobile phone , ear-connect
and all the money in cash he had and run away. Many men were
seeing this but no one interfered them showing how selfless
are Rich people's then.
After some time Dad and mom came
DAD
Why is you're knight broken.
BOBY
(thinking some time)
It was abusi'n me.
(He told lie because he
don't want that his
parent know about his
bringing of his mobile
phone)
DAD
Why?
BOBY
May be malfunctioning. I just told
it you'll be switched off tomorrow.
DAD
For that you broke it. Let's go.
11.
Suraj and his mother went off to eat the snatched food items.
Rohan went to Hritim
ROHAN
Mujhe mobile phone and paise mile
hai.
HRITIM
(lifting face up)
Kaha se mila?
ROHAN
(confused)
Wahi road ke kinare pada tha
HRITIM
Accha. Tumhi the na waha pe lafda
karne wale.
ROHAN
(smiling)
HRITIM
Jao usko de ke aao jiska hai.
ROHAN
Ab jaunga to maara jaunga. Aur
vaise bhi itne se unka kuchh nahi
bigadne wala par tera bhala ho
jayega .
HRITIM
Hmmn Hmmn. Mera bhala ho jayega!
ROHAN
Tera SSI karne ka man tha na, tera
phone aeroplane me chhoot gaya tha
na. Ab tu isse padh sakta hai.
Dekh mere paas lagbag 3500 rupyee
hai, chalo isse kuchh khaate hai.
Aur baaki bache paiso se tere
padhai ka kharacha ....
HRITIM
Kuchh aur logo ko dede ye rupye.
ROHAN
Sun , yaha par tu hi jo is rupye
aur phone ko sarthak upyog kar
sakta hai. Unka kya hai, unka roj
ka hai .
12.
HRITIM
Lekin itne me mera padhai poora
kaise hoga.
ROHAN
Tension na le, Jitna lagega mai
tujhe laake doonga. Bas tu theek se
padhai kar . Jab bada aadmi ban
jayega to in sab ka bhala kar dena.
HRITIM
Accha theek pahle chal ,kisi cyber
cafe me , is mobile phone ko hack
karna hai, ye locked hai aur track
kiya ja sakta hai. Mujhe isko reset
karna hai.
ROHAN
Ye hui na baat, chal.
Hritim himself hacked down cell phone in order to make it
untracable and unlocked the device. Then they went to small
yet advanced food stall for some food.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
(eating food)
Kaha se seekha hai ye sab?
HRITIM
(smiling)
My father !
ROHAN
Tere pita to bahut intelligent the
yaar...
Tu abhi yahi rah, mai gao ki taraf
koi room dekh leta hu. Shayad saste
me mil jaye.
Hritim started the cellphone and started studying online .
After around 4 hours Rohan returned.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Room mil gayi.
HRITIM
Kaha ?
ROHAN
Vahi , gao ki taraf, 700 rupye me
HRITIM
Per month?
13.
ROHAN
(nodding head)
Yes
Now they settled down into that room. Hritim focused into his
studies and Rohan usually goes outside to earn some money. He
goes at morning and comes at evening. After a month.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Yaar hritim , maine enough rupye
kama liye to kyo na city me chale
koi room dekhne.
HRITIM
(surprised)
Kitne rupye ho gaye ki sapne badha
liye .
ROHAN
(trying to cut hritm)
Aam khao , guthli na gino.
While going toward city, they saw suraj and his sister, He
was busy on building his house and His sister was helping him
.
HRITIM
From where is he making money?
ROHAN
Abe itna shak kyo karte ho .
HRITIM
Mai Room mobile se hi dhoondh sakta
hu.
ROHAN
To lo , mere mobile se dhoondho.
HRITIM
(surprised)
Ye kab khareede
ROHAN
(rubbing his left eye)
Are hua 2-3 din.
HRITIM
(confused)
Tum kuchh gadbad to nahi kar rahe
ho na. Kaam kya karte ho?
14.
ROHAN
Fir?
Ek kapde ki dukaan par kaam karta
hu.
HRITIM
Par 18 saal se kam age walo se kaam
karana to jurm hai na.
ROHAN
Itna koi nahi dekhta hai? Mai
licenced labourer nahi hu.
Hritim searched for room and booked it online . They started
living there in pretty advanced room. Since they were tired
by cleaning and maintaining their new room, they slept early.
Early with hritim woke up, There were lots of flashbacks in
the mind of Hritim of time when he was living with his father
in advanced room. After some time rohan also woke up.
HRITIM
(Looking at the new room)
My father connected each and every
gadgets of my room with his mind.
He just has to think of it, and
corresponding things starts to
work.
ROHAN
Heee....., sochne se.
HRITIM
Mujhe pata hai ki kaise hota hai ,
it's technology .
ROHAN
Are bhai,..
(pause)
Kaise hota hai thoda batao
HRITIM
Vo ek chemical ..
(interrupted)
Suraj enters room .
SURAJ
(stretching face)
Wow, nice room
ROHAN
Ha ha
15.
Suraj started playing with advanced items in the room. It was
new for him. After few minutes
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Chalo chalte hai.
HRITIM
Kaha
SURAJ
Tum padho, mai suraj se kah raha hu
HRITIM
Ha samajh raha hu, kaha ja rahe ho

ROHAN
Are city me aaye hai , thoda ghoom
lene do.
HRITIM
Accha...
(pause)
Kabtak aaoge ..
ROHAN
Wahi apne time par, sham 5 baje ke
aas paas.
HRITIM
Theek
Hritim started studying . Day passed on . It's been 8 PM but
still rohan didn't came. Hritim was bit nervous. He then
opened his mobile and tracked the location of rohan. He went
there and found that alone Rohan was fighting with some men.
Rohan was about to get shot with gun with one man but Hritim
came at last moment and hitted that man with a Iron rod. His
Gun fell down which was then picked up by Rohan . With his
red eyes full of tears and in mood of revenge he shot that
man in head and all others run off. Hritim shouting out "No
No don't " . Hritim was shocked.
After shoting Rohan was crying loud , and threw the gun with
anger . He was having a mixed feeling of remorse, tension,
anger.
Hritim immediately ran off toward the gun, he put gun into
the water to remove the finger prints . And then asked him to
go to room , hiding from mens ,AI and camera's. Rohan was not
moving , he was crying hard. Hritim feeling shocked as Rohan
even didn't cried that much during his father's death.
16.
Rohan after some time then points his finger toward a dead
body. When he rotate the body with his leg with sandal (for
saving himself proof of body print) , He was shocked as it
was Suraj who was lying dead there. He immediately said, is
there anything here which is you're so that we don't leave
any proof here. Rohan then said "yes, that small bag". Hritim
took it and put it in his pocket and along with Rohan he ran
off into there room.
When they came onto there room , they were shocked again as
Suraj's mom was inside the room came searching for his son.
Rohan was still and did not speak any thing.
SURAJ'S MOM
Suraj tumhare saath hi hai na?
HRITIM
Nahi, wo hamare saath to nahi hai.
Kyo kya hua.
SURAJ'S MOM
(afraid)
Wo kahke gaya tha ki mai rohan ke
saath kaam pe ja raha hu , sham ko
aunga. Par abhi tak aaya nahi. Aaj
vo mobile phone lene wala tha.
HRITIM
Ha ho sakta hai ki aaya raha ho
room pe, par ham subah hi city ke
liye nikal gaye the to vo kaam pe
akela hi chala gaya hoga. Dekho kal
tak shayad aa jaye, kabhi kaam
jyada hota hai.
SURAJ'S MOM
Accha beta pata chale kuchh to
batana ,
HRITIM
Theek
As soon as she went out , Hritim closed the door ,and opened
the bag. He slapped his brother.
HRITIM (CONT'D)
Kya hai ye,
ROHAN
(silently looking down
with remorse)
17.
HRITIM
To drugs aur chori ke paiso se mai
apni padhai kar raha hu.
Ye drugs ka dhandha kabse .
Bol?
ROHAN
Purane room join karne ke just 3
din baad. Mai job dhoondhte ,
dhoondhte ek clothing shop ke paas
gaya
EXT. FLASHBACK
ROHAN
Please koi job dedo, mai akela hu
SHOP OWNER
Nahi mere paas koi kaam nahi hai.
ROHAN
Koi kaam dedo , mai 3 din se
dhoondh raha hu, mere bhai ko
padhana hai.
SHOP OWNER
Bhag yaha se....
Rohan went off some distance and later on shop owner followed
him.
SHOP OWNER (CONT'D)
Ruk , Ruk
ROHAN
Mere paas tere liye ek kaam hai ,
karega
SHOP OWNER
Par ye kisi ko pata nahi chalna
chahiye
(PAUSED)
Mere pas ek kaam hai jo tum log
karoge to sabse accha hai , kyoki
robots ke andar sensors hoti hai jo
apne kaam ka data bhejte rahte hai
aur vo track ho jaate hai. Police
tum chhote baccho par shak nahi
karegi .
ROHAN
Kya hai
18.
SHOP OWNER
Drugs supply karega. Tumhe bas unko
deni hai jinko mai bolunga, kahi
door nahi isi shahar me. Aur ho
sake to aur logo ko becho mere se
batakar. Darknet pe mere pass
contract aata hai, bas tumhe supply
karna hai.
Suno , aur tumhare saath koi aur
nahi hai, do log rahoge to jyada
better rahega.
INT. ROOM- NIGHT
Hritim was switching off his and rohan's cellphone.
ROHAN
Bas aise hi hamne supply karna
shuru kar diya.
Mai anath tha ...
Mai mara jaata to theek tha par vo
suraj and aur uski nirdosh maa meri
wajah se .......
(again started weeping)
HRITIM
Kya hua tha waha , kaise uski jaan
gayi.
ROHAN
Hamko ek ladke ko drug dete hue
uske bade bhai ne pakad liya. Fir
jab hame pata chala ki vo log hame
dhoondh rahe ham waha se bhaag
nikle , par unko pata chal gaya .
HRITIM
Police ko kyo nahi bulaye. Turant
to aa jaati hai.
ROHAN
Hamare paas drugs tha , kaise
bulate . Hame laga ki ham sambhal
lenge.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
(in afraid)
Par vo log jo bhage the, vo mujhe
dekhe the , kahi police se na bata
de.
19.
HRITIM
Nahi vo khud nahi batayenge , kyoki
vo goli jiske bandook se nikla hai
vo khud mara pada hai . Uska sir
paani ke kinare hai, police ko
lagega ki vo suicide hai. Agar vo
log batayenge to khud fas jayenge.
(paused)
Par yadi kisi tarah se pakde gaye
to , vo tumko jaroor batayenge,
Ya, jab suraj ki body unko milegi
to suraj ki maa ke paas jayenge aur
uski maa ko ham par shak ho sakta
hai. isse pahle kuchh ho chalo kahi
door chalte hai.
ROHAN
Kaha jayenge?
HRITIM
Tumhare papa pahle jaha kaam karte
the. Shayad waha ham milkar kaam
kar sakte hai.
ROHAN
Theek hai. Par mere account me 21
lakh hai.
HRITIM
Ham ye saara paisa suraj ki maa ko
de denge .
ROHAN
4 lakh apne liye rakh lete hai.
Tere padhai me kaam aayega .
HRITIM
Mujhe tere ye khooni paiso se
padhai nahi karni hai. Saath me
kaam karenge . Ho jayega...
ROHAN
Dekh mai suraj ka kasam kha ke
kahta hu ki mai indesciplined way
se ab nahi kamaunga. Jo kamaunga or
organic hoga.
Please 4 lakh apne liye rakh le,
itna sab tere liye hi to kiya tha.
HRITIM
Ham aaj raat ko hi niklenge ... kya
naam tha us mall ka
20.
ROHAN
Alton noyce canvas
HRITIM
Chalo pahle suraj ke ghar chalte
hai.
ROHAN
Par uski maa....
HRITIM
Chalo
SURAJ'S MOM
Pata chala mere bete ka,
HRITIM
Ha, usne call kiya tha , kaha ki
mai kal aaunga .
Aur usne kaha ki tumhare account me
1 lakh rupye daal diye hai.
SURAJ'S MOM
Mere paas to account nahi tha.
HRITIM
Ha vo suraj ne apne mobile se khola
tha account aur initial balance ke
naam par ye paise daale hai.
SURAJ'S MOM
(afraid)
Kuchh gadbad to nahi hai . Ye sab
achanak kyo ho raha hai.
Turn around his face from suraj's mom , There were tears in
his eyes. He came out wiping his tears.
Hritim asked his phone to find the location of alton noyce
canvas, It seems out that there were many such locations, but
then rohan said Lucknow by looking at phone. So it gave them
route. Hritim asked phone to book tickets for them for hypertrain. It automatically booked 2 tickets as it was tracking
down the talk between them and knew that there were 2 who
were deciding to go.
A very advanced view of city is on screen which is zoomed
out. After view finishes there were on the hyper-loop
station.
21.
A fast-moving train came and stopped suddenly. The speed of
that train was around 900 km/h. They and some other men sat.
The train automatically verified the payment through his
phone without any manual processing. And there came inside
the train.
From outside the train started immidiately to 900km/h but
from innerside it looks like train is not moving at all. No
inertia , nothing. After some time, hritim sent 16 lakh to
the account of suraj's mom.
ROHAN
Tum ek hi baar ek 17 lakh deke
chale aate ,
HRITIM
Uski maa ko shak ho jaata aur hame
aane nahi deti. Par ye batana tha
ki ye account uska hai, to 1 lakh
daalkar bata diye.
Camera shows of some window scene showing the advancement of
city from window. After around 14 minutes they reach there
destination and after that they reach to Rihu's shop i.e
alton noyce canavs.
ROHAN
Namaste , uncle ji
RIHU
(shocked and confused)
Tum , tum ..kaise, tum to us
aeroplane me..
ROHAN
Iske papa ne ham dono ko bacha liya
tha parachute se.
RIHU
Ohh.
Abtak kaha the.
ROHAN
Door the, aa nahi paye. Mujhe koi
kaam mil sakta hai kya .
RIHU
(hesitatingly)
Jab maine suna ki tum log maare
gaye, maine waha par noyce
Intelligence ka AI deploy kar,
diya.
22.
ROHAN
Please hame kuchh kaam de do,
RIHU
Tum 18 se kam ke ho na, allowed
nahi hai.
ROHAN
Kuchh chhota sa hi de do.
RIHU
Aise kaam robot's tumse behtar
karte hai, aur mai itne bade
frenchise ko humans se nahi
karaunga. I have bought it from
alton noyce intel , a sibling
company of my franchise. They won't
allow it.
ROHAN
(looking angrily toward
robot)
Inhi se sab kaam karwate ho , thoda
to raham karo hampe. Ham jiye..
khayange kaise. Mere papa ne yaha
25 saal diye hai.
RIHU
Tera baap mere yaha tabse karta
tha, jab mere paas ye franchise
nahi thi, Koi AI nahi thi,Indian
job security rules ke according mai
usko nikaal nahi paaya.
HRITIM
Mujhe thoda sa in robot's ko use
karne do, I'll go away. Mere papa
iske baare me baat karte the par
maine kabhi use nahi kiya.
RIHU
Tere baap ka hai? Aukaat me raha
kar. Ye alton noyce ka product
hai, "World top brand". Even
american companies don't come close
to . It captures more that 65% of
worlds market. Nikal ja yaha se.
ROHAN
Ha jaa rahe hai.
Chal...
After going somewhat distance.
23.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Ye bots to hamara jeena haram kar
rakha hai. Har jaga alton noyce ,
alton noyce , iski ....
HRITIM
Mere paas ek idea hai, mai inko
hack sakta hu.
ROHAN
Sacchi. Mujhe laga tune kabhi use
nahi kiya hai.
HRITIM
Nahi kiya hai, par kaise use karte
hai maine internet se dekha hai.
Aur mere papa ne iski ek secret
bataye the . Kahe the ki agar inke
sir ke paas "ecyon" bol do to inka
circuit fail ho jata hai. Ye
security backup ke banaya gaya hai.
Taaki agar koi rogue bot ho to rok
sake.
ROHAN
Tere papa ne tere ko kya kya ,
bataye hai bhai. Har cheez .
(paused)
Tera plan kya hai.
HRITIM
Chupke se ladki bankar ham dono
andar cloth lene jayenge. Ham alton
virtual world me thoda enjoy
karenge , fir jab bot hame doosra
cloth dikhane ke liye robot aayega
to ham hack kar lenge.
ROHAN
Ab ye Alton ka virtual world kya
hai,
HRITIM
Sab virtual reality hai. Isme tum
us kapde me kaise lagte ho , doosro
se feedback le sakte ho. Usi kapde
se virtually shahar me ghoom sakte
ho, taki tum khud decide kar sako.
ROHAN
Oh, to sheeshe ki tarah hota hai.
(stretching lips)
24.
HRITIM
Ha, kah sakte ho.
They did like this , but when they hacked the 3rd bot, there
were shouting alarm for danger sign. Rohan was having fun
with VR and inside the VR he was girl (as he wearing a girls
dress) and forgot about plans. Then Hritim removed the glass
from rohan's eye. Rohan was confused , Hritim said to run.
They both strategically came out of shop somehow without
being caught.
ROHAN
Are yaar mai to bhool hi gaya tha
ki mai ladka hu, itna realistic....
HRITIM
Sun ab mai tujhe jo batata hu waisa
hi karega..
ROHAN
Bol
Hritim and Rohan planned something...
After planning , they went again to that mall.
RIHU
Firse aa gaye tum log,
ROHAN
Nahi kuchh siren bajne ki aawaj
aaya to ham chale aaye , laga ki
aag lag gaya hoga.
RIHU
Nahi sab sahi hai. Bug raha hoga.
ROHAN
Bug tha ya tumhare robots kharab ho
gaye.
RIHU
(looking confused)
Robots kharab ho gaye, tumko kaise
pata chala.
ROHAN
Hmnn. Ham robots handle karne me
expert hai.
(flirting with his eye
toward hritim)
(MORE)
25.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Jaha pe aeroplane crash hua tha,
ham yahi karte the par socha ki
jaha hamare papa kaam karte kyo na
wahi kare... ....
(after pause)
Apne is talent ka use.
RIHU
Dimag mat kha
ROHAN
Ham robot ko theek kar sakte, par
ek shart par, aap mujhe kaam karne
denge,
RIHU
Auto-Mechanic aata hi hoga....
ROHAN
Par jitna tum usko theek karne ka
pay karoge , usse kam me mai kar
doonga.
RIHU
Theek hai, lo theek karo
Rohan and hritim took out those robot , and hritim made it
reworking.
ROHAN
Lo sahi kar diya hamne,
RIHU
Accha kitna de tumko.
ROHAN
Mujhe kaam par rakh lo to kuchh
nahi lenge,
Asuming Rohan as a technician he find it beneficial to add
him into his workforce.
This way time passed on , Hritim was studying hard and rohan
was working in Rihu's office. If there was any technical
needs hritim repaired it and gave credit to rohan. This way 6
years has been passed . Now they're in there 20's of age.
It's been much time of taking oath for not earning
undeciplined money but still he sometimes practices it as
after he was 18 years and Rihu didn't hiked his salary as per
market, so he defrauds in his shop which is supposed to
normal at that time.
Time came when Hritim has to go for his training as he has
cracked one of the toughest examination (SSI) of the world.
26.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Mere bhai ne kamal kar diya.
Tune apne pita ka and
(feeling emotional)
Suraj ke maut ka maan rakh liya.
Thoda yaar SSI ke baare me bata ,
suna hai uske baare me par jyada
kuchh janta nahi hu.
HRITIM
(smiling)
SSI matlab specialized services of
india.
ROHAN
Ab ye kya hai
HRITIM
This can be an organization that is
responsible for providing highly
skilled and specialized services to
the government and private sector.
It can be a top-secret organization
that deals with sensitive matters,
such as national security and
intelligence gathering. The
organization can have a team of
highly trained and intelligent
individuals who are experts in
various fields such as technology,
engineering, medicine, and more.
HRITIM (CONT'D)
Aah, you can think it as
combination of UPSC, IIT , military
and secret agent.
ROHAN
I don't know them either, lekin
chalo theek hai. Lekin Samajh gaya
ki allrounder hona padta hai.
Lagbhag kitne paise lagenge tere
training me.
HRITIM
No money.
Even government would pay me extra
money. Now you won't have to earn.
You did for me so much. Now let me
earn for our livelihood.
(holding rohans hand)
Thank you so much
rohan puts Hritims head into his shoulder.
27.
ROHAN
I owe your father my life. So no
need for a thanks.
HRITIM
Never say that again.
ROHAN
Joining kab se hai,
HRITIM
Ek mahine me.
ROHAN
Let's have fun until then.
They went different parks ,zoo's and many beautiful places
together. They shopped clothing , and several items for fun .
It was first time when they were freely enjoying each other's
company . Free from their responsibilites.
Now its time Hritim to go for his training. Hritim Hugged
Rohan tightly and weeping as he won't be coming until his
training was completed which is 4 years.
In the mean while, Rohan opened NGO with the money He had
earned earlier and that of Hritim salary. He created SSC
(Suraj social cooperation) which helps, trains and generates
employement for poor men. Some more similar oraganizations
were merged into SSC. They themselves opened lots of shops,
malls and different things which doesn't involve any AI or
robots. They were completely human employed places. There
major focus was to create opportunity and sell items at cheap
prices rather providing advanced technologies or using them.
Those shops, stationaries and malls were distributed over
whole India. Rohan was famous over India.
Rohan sometimes uses his power to destroy malls where no
humans were working and after that he opens up his own. Like
he used quaking weapon to shake the earth beneath one very
advanced mall named Rofter Run Shine which generated around
13 Richter of earthquake and falled all buildings. He then
buyed that place and made his new Malls where only humans
worked .
This way he used his influence and terror to mitigate some of
the high tech places and operated his own SSC. This generated
very much employment. The few poors now has at least some
work to do if not all. The high tech shops still blossoms .
Hritim meanwhile is getting trained himself. He is learning
fast to operate with technologies , hiding himself, thinking
strategically and many other aspect fighting skills.
28.
Whenever he has to buy something he travels 60km into his
brothers cooperation and buy things as much as he can.
Although for some of the items he has to go to Alton's shop
as SSC does not have it. Alton didn't care about SSC as it
was a giant in itself sharking 68% of market by now.
After 4 years, Hritim has to come back to home. Rohan with
his high tech Fastcopter came to bring Hritim.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
(Saying to his guardsmen
in proud loud voice and
going toward Rohan)
He is my brother, my brother. See ,
He is the reason I'm here. It was
his idea to open SSC and help
unemployed.
Hritim came running and hugged his brother. They sat into the
fastcopter.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
How's this fastcopter.
HRITIM
Nice , Nice. You've done it.
Uncle ka alton noyce ka kya haal
hai. Uncle ji kaise hai.
ROHAN
(hesitatingly)
He is not alive.
A flash backs scene poped up.
Rohan with his fastcopter and wearnign fashion goggles going
into the mall toward the Rihu.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Hey uncle, Kitne me apna ye
franchise bechoge.
RIHU
(surprised)
Mai kyo bechunga.
ROHAN
Common, I need it, you know.
You have lots of robot's and I hate
them thousand times more than you
hate human workforce.
RIHU
Security, bahar feko ise...
29.
ROHAN
Wow, what a nice chance to fight
with robots.... Mai yahi to 8 saalo
se chahta tha.
Common,
He was fighting with robots, as no humans other than rihu,
was there. Whenever he was losing with robots , he just has
to say "ecyon"(code word told by his brothe) and robots just
fell down. He was using the term at last, because he was
enjoying the fight between robots and himself. The fight goes
on, Rihu shouted "bring guns and shot him down".
Then fighting robots came out with weapons, and at the same
time trained guards of Rohan came to the mall with high tech
weapons and guns. A full scale weaponized fight action scene
between guards of Rohan and robots.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
(going toward Rihu)
See, tumhe bas ye mall mujhe saupna
tha ,aur mai tujhe jane deta. Waise
bhi unintentionally tune to mera
madad kiya hi hai. Lekin tu manega
nahi.
Rohan took out a weapon from his pocket. And fight is still
going on b/w robots and guards.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Rihu, tu tension na le, maine data
transfer ciese kar diya tha ...
pahuchte hi, ab yaha se koi data
nahi jaane wala satellite par, aur
koi police ko bhanak bhi nahi
lagegi ki hua kya .
Bas tu jaldi se , apna mall SSC ke
naam kar de. Warna
(taking out a weapon out
his pocket)
You know this, it just increases
the heart rate and that's it.
RIHU
Dekh, tu chahta hai ki mai robot's
ko hata ke insaano ko job pe rakh
lu. Mai rakhunga.. tu jaisa kahega
mai vaisa hi karunga.. Bas chhod
de.. Lo mai tere ko ye mall ka
ownership tere ko de deta hu
Rihu took out his mobile phone, and transferred his mall
ownership to the SSC .
30.
ownership is done using a variation of blockchain technology
those day. It was failing as data transfer was stopped and no
internet linkage. Rohan shot down all the camera's and
microphones and reopened data transfer. Now the shop is
legally of SSC.
ROHAN
Yo know what , I'm of limited idea
man. I'm not like my brother that
have bundles of ideas.
I don't want to kill you, but ye
jaroori hai, warna tu mere khilaf
kuchh na kuchh to karega hi. Tu
mere bhai ko bata dega iske baare
me.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Gareeb log hi apni jaan dekar
doosro ki madad kyo kare. Tum log
bhi kar sakte ho. Par late ho gaye
tum.
Rohan put weapon at his chest at front of his heart , and
Rihu was dead.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
(murmered)
Late. Rihu pandit......
Rohan and his men went away.
Since data transfer was opened , police came, but got no
clues about how it happened and How all robots were broken
or switched off.
Rihu's son went to police station.
RIHU'S SON
Rohan has something to do with my
father's death.
POLICE
Rohan ke baare aise bolne se pahle
thoda bhi dar nahi lagta. Kitna
respectable man hai. Logo ki madad
karta hai.
RIHU'S SON
SSC has now its ownership. It
transferred just before his death.
POLICE
Do you have any proof or it may be
coincidence.
31.
RIHU'S SON
(silent)
But....
POLICE
Sorry , we cannot do anything until
a proof for such respectable man.
In fact maine bhi ye police hone ka
skill SSC coorporation se hi seekhi
hai. Maine internet se padh to li
thi par training and in-hand
experinece ke liye mere paas paise
nahi the, He helped me.
Rihu's son got to know that he is helpless and police won't
be helping him.
INT. FASTCOPTER-NOON
Flashback closed , now current scene.
ROHAN
Usse hamne uska mall khadreed
liya, par kuchh der baad pata nahi
kaise heart attack ho gaya. Kai din
se bimar chal raha tha.
HRITIM
(sadly)
Didn't he had medicine.
ROHAN
I don't know.
As soon as they were at home. Rohan brought Hritim to his
headquarter .
ROHAN (CONT'D)
See , Now we have advanced 3d
holographic new board .
Hritim and Rohan looking at it and smiling. But suddenly
newboard was showing that Pathpro's owner's prison time was
over.
HRITIM
(looking at ajit)
He has a remaining debt on us.
Let's go to see him in his house.
ROHAN
Kal chalte hai, uske paas. Vyora
lene.
32.
HRITIM
Ha, aaj tere kaarname dekhte hai.
Hritim was happy to see that his brother was helping so much
for poor peoples livelihood. They all were happy.
On next day , they reach at Ajit's house.
AJIT
(seeing Rohan)
Are you here buy my airport for
SSC.
I don't have any share of it.
I sold all of them.
ROHAN
NO..
AJIT
Then surely any of your family
members was dead on that air
accident?
HRITIM
(A bit surprised, )
You're gonna tell us everything ,
what happened that day.
AJIT
Kyo? Kyo batau mai tumhe. Maine
kitno ko bataya par kisi ne yakeen
nahi kiya. Tum kyo karoge.
ROHAN
Kuchh jyada tedha nahi bol raha
hai??
HRITIM
Batao kya hua tha. I am SSI so
maybe I can help you.
AJIT
To tum bhi ek sarkari kathpuli hoge
, kyo?
ROHAN
(looking at hritim)
Ye sab kya bol raha hai ye.
Saaf saaf bata.
33.
AJIT
Mai ek din apne airport pe tha. Ek
admi jo mere airport pe kaam karta
tha jiska naam sharad tha vo mere
paas aake ..
Flashback scene
SHARAD
(feeling shy)
Sir, mere ko 5 lakh advance de do,
mere patni ke cancer ka ilaj
karwana hai. Maine bank se 10 lakh
liye hai ,par usse jyada vo log
nahi de rahe, mere paas bank ke
liye security bas itna hi tha.
AJIT
(in loud voice)
Nahi , mere paas nahi hai.
SHARAD
De do sir, apka 10 din se intejaar
kar raha hu, aaj aap aye hai office
me. Please de do. Mai apka karj
chuka doonga. Kaam karke.
AJIT
Dekh , Mai usme se hu, jo robot ke
alawa insaano ko bhi job karne ka
mauka deta hu. To bahas mat kar aur
nikal ja.
(paused)
Shukr mana ki mai tum jaiso ko job
pe rakhta hu, warna kahi tum bhi
bheekh maang rahe hote road par.
Sharad fell down on ajit's feet and requested him, but
Haven't got any benefit.
SHARAD
Security, just fire him now.
FLASHBACK OFF, CURRENT SCENE.
ROHAN
To tu human employees ko rakhta
tha.
SHARAD
Hmmn. Par ek din mere phone pe news
aata hai ki ek aeroplane crash ho
gaya hai.
(MORE)
34.
SHARAD (CONT'D)
Ye 24-25 saal me pahli baar tha aur
Indian sarkaar ka bahut strict
rules hai koi public accident hone
ka kisi company par. Government 5
saal tak company ko unlist kar deti
hai. Isse share prices bahut gir
jaate hai, credibility ,funds sab
kuchh band ho jaata hai . Isiliye
is tarah ki accident nahi hote hai
aaj ka.
Mai soch hi raha tha ki ye kaise
hua , tabtak police aa gayi...
FLASHBACK
POLICE
You're under arrest.
SHARAD
(shouting)
I haven't done anything, Mujhe nahi
pata kaise hua ye sab.
CURRENT SCENE.
AJIT
Mere airport me CCTV camera's lage
huye the, there all were encrypted
and In my mobile phone, I had it's
decryption key. So court asked me
to show them all video recordings .
FLASHBACK
AI JUDGE
Show us the video..
AJIT
Ok, ye encrypted hai. Mere paas
decryption key hai is mobile me...
to ye lo ..
Ajit gave the decryption key on the court ,but when they
tried to open it, it showed wrong decryption key.
AI JUDGE
Crack it using quantum computing ..
35.
They tried to crack it using quantum computing but were
unsuccessfull.
AI JUDGE (CONT'D)
You know, You are using Quantaadded RSA algo for encryption,
quantum computer even cannot hack
it. Tum jante the, isi isiliye
tumne decryption key edit kar diya.
Tumhe pata hai na iski saja kya
hogi...
Abhi samay hai, hame decryption key
de do.
AJIT
Yahi to tha, maine koi editing
nahi ki hai.
AI JUDGE
Par tumhara phone hi dikha raha hai
"modified today". Aur tumhe aaj hi
arrest kiya gaya tha.
AJIT
Mujhe nahi pata , Sir, mujhe nahi
pata ... firse check kariye.
FLASHBACK OFF. CURRENT SCENE.
AJIT
Is tarah se mujhe 2 mahine ki jagah
10 saal ka saja mila and penality
of 30 crores, because judge ko laga
ki isme meri hi galti hai . Isiliye
mai video nahi dikha raha.
HRITIM
So that's why you sold all the
shares.
AJIT
Ha, Share price gir gaya tha ,
penality bharne ke liye maine saare
shares Alton noyce Air ko sell kar
diya. My shares worth was around 24
crores at that time and was still
falling . But Alton noyce gave me
30 crores .
ROHAN
(murmuring)
Ab Alton noyce Air....,
Har jagah Alton noyce , har jagah.
(MORE)
36.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Aainda iska naam bhi mat lena ,
Isko mai barbaad dekhna chahta hu.
AJIT
Par mujhe baad me pata chala.. jab
mai prison me tha , ki ab pathpro
ka managing director, Sharad ban
chuka hai and uske paas around 3%
ke shares hai , pathpro ke. I don't
know how it happened .
HRITIM
Apna phone dena ,
Ajit gave his old phone, Hritim checked his phone . After few
minutes
HRITIM (CONT'D)
Hmmn, Programmatically...
(paused)
A file modification is done by
removing old data and creating new
one.
AJIT
Yes, ofcourse, so
HRITIM
You haven't used it from then,
right?
AJIT
Nahi tabse to nahi use kiya....
HRITIM
What if we make a computer program
which tries to read every
consecutive 5120 cells ,that is....
5kb which is that of decryption key
size of memory with bruteforce and
try to decrypt the video. It's
because very much possibility that
rewriting of edited file is done at
different memory location due to
concurrency support.
AJIT
Can we?
37.
HRITIM
Do you know some of the letters,
like that of first letter or so
because it would help me to filter
useless starting memory location
and retrieve key fast.
AJIT
Yes, as far as I remember, I was
starting with one e hyphen f . And
I don't remember extra. Oh thats
enough.
But meri madad tum kyo karna
chahoge.
ROHAN
Teri kisko padi hai, Ham dono ke
baap aeroplane me maare gaye the.
AJIT
Mujhe laga ki tum dono bhai ho...
HRITIM
(video kaha hai)
AJIT
Vo video to cloud pe store hai,
tumko airport jana padega, aur khud
hi lana padega. Kyoki
HRITIM
Par ham police station jakar kyo na
firse tumhara file open karwate
hai, is baar mai decrypt karunga.
AJIT
Aise ve nahi mangenge , tumhe unko
decrypted video hi dikhana padega.
For that you need the video. And
you have to steal it from there.
HRITIM
Theek hai par ham andar kaise
jayenge . Mujhe airport ka
architecture nahi maloom.
AJIT
I was the owner. I have my
authorized id card for entrance
into control room. Come I'll show
you how to whole architecture.
And one thing to note is that major
of the workforce now is that of
ladies.
38.
On a big screen in his home, Ajit shows all the design ,
rooms and architecture of airport and shows him the control
room. He said in it, there is only one man inside it and rest
of them are robots.
Hritim and Rohan came back to their home.
HRITIM
Hame planning karni padegi , taaki
koi galti na ho.
ROHAN
Ha, koi galti nahi kar sakte
ham....
HRITIM
To plan ye hai, kyoki waha par kai
saare security guards rahenge , to
tum unko distract karoge, Taaki
maximum drones , camera and logo ka
focus unke paas rahe aur mai apna
kaam aram se kar saku.
Suddenly , Hritim takes out gun from his belt and targets to
his brother. Hritim started laughing . Rohan sees a chain
handing out of no where.
ROHAN
(laughing)
Tum apne training ke wakt magic
dikhate the. Kya? Ye...ye. chain
kaise latka hua hai.
HRITIM
You know , Us aeroplane me.... agar
tumhe yaad ho to mere papa ne apne
wrist pe dekh ke rrivirr ko bulaya
tha.
ROHAN
Ha to,
HRITIM
Vo unka invisible watch tha. It was
undetectable until you touch it
with your bare hand. It
automatically capture your facial
expression, nervous signal, blood
flow to guess what you were
thinking Like that some of mind
reading magician.
ROHAN
To tumhare haath me kya hai.
39.
HRITIM
An invisible gun..
ROHAN
(surprised)
Is it , let me see. Tumhare paas
kaise.
HRITIM
Ah, baad me bataunga. Abhi nahi.
You have to be smart while
operating as it work you your
ability to touch and feel.
ROHAN
Okay , par touch to karne de.
HRITIM
Lo,
Rohan was feeling it . His mouth was opened .
ROHAN
How it works, automatically ? Or
koi button ya trigger hai. Goli bhi
transparent hoti hai kya?
HRITIM
Mere papa ne mujhe bataya tha is
invisible technology ke baare me.
Unhone kaha tha, kisi ko batana
mat... is technology ke baare me.
You just know that it is just
combination of optics and chemical
.
ROHAN
Par tumhare paas kaise aaya..
HRITIM
Maine training period ke dauran
banaya tha. Jab hame ek mission pe
bheja jane wala tha , tab maine
banaya tha. I added some technics
of my own ,par jyadatar maine apne
papa se seekha tha.
ROHAN
Ek second , kis mission pe gaye
the,
40.
HRITIM
Just a small mission . Kuchh
looters ne Assam me ek pariwaar ko
bandi bana liye the, and we have to
clear them secretly. they came
there for looting money as he was a
rich man.
ROHAN
Tumlogo se kyo, military se kyo
nahi
HRITIM
I mean vo log bhi the, par as a
training we were also there...
FLASH BACK
Looters has killed some of the military persons and some of
them were made hostile . Then Hritim enters the hostile
house.. as a friend of house owner . All military persons
were hostiled in a room.
LOOTER
Kaun hai be tu, hath upar kar..
Hritim touched his pocket and put his hand up
HRITIM
(surprised face and trying
to distract)
Tum log kaun ho..
He then killed main looter(say l1) who was holding the owner
neck. 2 others(say l2 and l3) were pointing there gun toward
owner standing beside l1. When he was killed, l2 thought that
l3 killed l1 and l3 thought that l2 killed l1.
L3
Tumne kyo mara
L2
Maine?
L3
Tune kyo maara .
And L3 shot L2 and L2 shot L3 simultaneously as they both
pointed gun to each other.
Then Hritim went toward room where more looters were there,
he fought them skillfully without using gun as other squad
members were watching him.
41.
He then got a medal for it.
FLASHBACK OFF. CURRENT SCENE.
ROHAN
(Medal in his hand)
Let me have a photo with it, for
social media.
He kept his phone on the desk and commanded phone to take a
photo.
Next morning, they have to execute the plan . Hritim was
putting some bullets into his invisible gun. As soon as
bullet enters the gun , it gets dissapeared.
They used their car to go to airport. When Rohan was going
inside the car , there were many mens and womens for the
respect of Rohan wishing good morning .
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Kaam kaisa chal raha, Raju.
RAJU
(from crowd)
Very good.
Rohan blushed and sat into the car and they went out for
airport. Now they have to execute there plan.
On reaching to the airport, which was around 5000 km far.
They saw that most of the employees were woman and all were
wearing sexy dresses. It was obvious from there faces that
they were not happy . As soon as they reached to the airport,
many womans with half sexy dress coming to meet Rohan (as he
was famous). There were 3 mens also. Every girl , men wished
him afternoon. Rohan and Hritim were watching the situation
with moving there eyes toward airport for understanding the
circumstance.
They saw that a woman was pregnant of about 6 month talking
to other woman by keeping her hand below her belly.
PREGNANT WOMAN
(crying and afraid)
Main nahi ja sakti , mujhe doctor
ne rest ke liye kaha hai par uske
dar se chali aai.
OTHER WOMAN
Par jana to padega na,
42.
PREGNANT WOMAN
(hand folded for pleading
and crying)
Meri jaga aaj tum chali jao , mai
tumhara ahsaan jindgi bhar manungi,
Please raveena.
OTHER WOMAN
(bit emotional)
Pichhli baar richa , shreya ke
jagah par chali gayi thi, to usne
shreya ko job se nikal diya tha.
Sorry , mai nahi ja sakti. Mai abhi
kal hi gayi thi.
Suddenly Sharad came out of his room and forcefully brought
toward her toward his office room. This all was seen by
Rohan.
Rohan was bit surprised and confused.
ROHAN
(asking to the a woman)
Vo apni patni ko is tarah
jabardasti kyo le ja raha hai.
There was silence in the crowd . Its like all of them were
hiding something.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
(shouting and pointing
finger toward a man)
Tell me, is tarah kyo le jaa raha
hai.
Meanwhile hritim is busy understanding the view and situation
of airport.
MAN
(afraid)
vo uski patni nahi hai.
ROHAN
(angrily looking at
sharad's room side)
To waha apne room me le jaa raha
hai.
MAN
Vo uske saath sone jaa raha hai.
ROHAN
You mean....
43.
MAN
Usi ki wajah se saari ladkiya ,
chhote kapde pahan ke aati hai. He
made it mondatory for girls.
He has assigned a day to each girl
or woman to make him happy daily.
Aur uske badle vo ... unko naukri
pe rakhta hai.
ROHAN
(angry face)
Tum log ye kaam kyo karte ho. Chhod
kyo nahi dete.
MAN
Apne gareebi kaha dekhi hai, sir.
We have no other option than to let
him sleep with our wives and
daughter . Roj roj raste pe dhoop
me ,khali pet, dar dar bhatakne se
behtar hai ki ham bas ek din apni
biwi ya bachhio ko rote huye dekh
le.
ROHAN
(with red eye)
Tum log SSC kyo nahi join liye.
MAN
Yaha se sabse najdeeki SSC 1500 KM
pe hai. Samay to jaane aane me nahi
lagega , par SSC ki per day kamai
less than 600 hai and daily aane
jane ka kharcha 1200 hai. Aur vaise
bhi SSC me ab jagah hai , sab
position filled ho chuke hai.
ROHAN
Jaha ssc hai , wahi par room leke
rah jaate ,
MAN
room ka kharcha... hmh vo to perday
sirf ek log ka 250 ka hai. Ham teen
hai .
Similar situation is for all of
them.
Agar ye Alton noyce intel or
robot's na hote, ya SSC hamare yaha
bhi hota to .....
All women were just emotional and there face was down.
44.
Rohan went into his room by breaking the door and sees that
he was undressing pregnant women's skirt. He started beating
hard to sharad . Sharad was calling of for help but no men or
women was helping him, but then robots cameoff to help him
and most of the camera's turned around at him. He was running
but rohan was beating him . Robots started saving Sharad and
fighting with rohan. Rohan again started tearing off them and
saying "ecyon" to make some of them switch off.
Hritim seeing him, puts his thumbs up toward the Rohan and
murmering "I didn't told him to fight with chief." .He
started his plan. He already has seen all the situation and
places of airport while Rohan was talking with womens. He
hidingly tried to go into control room. But a flying
spherical camera was following him, so he ran and jumped and
caught the camera. And kept it at ground with lens down the
ground and broke its wind by hitting with his hands. Actually
it was with his invisible gun.
He hidingly entered into aisle ,which leads into control
room. A hidden camera saw him and started beeping . Other
robots thought that it would be because Rohan was fighting
with robot's at outdoor.
Rohan and sharad were fighting . Rohan was sitting on the
stomach of sharad and hitting beating on his face. After some
time pregnant women came out and snatched the gun from
robots. She then pointed the gun toward the Sharad .
ROHAN
tum mat kuchh karo, shoot mat
karna. Tumhare liye dikkat ho
jayegi.
Pregnant women was looking angrily at rohan. And slowly
moving the gun toward rohan
PREGNANT WOMAN
Mai use nahi , tumhe marne aayi hu.
Tumne mera sab kuchh chheen liya.
ROHAN
(surprised)
Maine , Maine kya kiya tumhara
But suddenly one robot shot down the girl and she was dead.
.Rohan suddenly spoke "ecyon" to the fighting robot's head
since they all were of alton noyce intel as airport was
bought by alton noyce's Air company. He used that robot as a
shield and hitted that robots with his switched off robot.
Later on he took away the gun from Robot's hand and shot down
that robot. With this gun he killed many robots that were
incoming.
45.
Back to Hritim. As Hritim was approaching door of control
room, a robot standing newby door , sent a message to other
robots that there is danger.
At rohan side , many robots has targetted to kill him, as
they were to pull the trigger, the message arrived and they
suddenly ran toward control room,
Rohan understood it, and ran after robots still killing them
from behind. But since saving control room was top priority
for robots, they didn't turned back toward Rohan. Sharad was
hurt very much,he was seeing it surprisingly. He then
murmered "just call police". A call initiated automatically
to the police station.
Back to Hritim , He has already switched door robot off. And
was about to put Ajit's id card onto the room's optical
opener , but he heard that someone was coming behind him, He
knew that its robots who were following him. He immediately
scanned his id and opened the control room door.
Rohan was still killing robots angrily who were running
toward Hritim. Much of robots were killed . When he entered
the room ,He saw that There was a young human women with
tears in her eyes and anger in her face and 2 robots , who
was seeing all situation in the CCTV camera at outdoor. As
soon as Hritim entered the room , the girl shot him in his
heart and lots of blood started coming out from Hritim.
Hritim fell down with his hand on belt . As soon as she went
front , Hritim took out invisible gun and shot both robots
and caught the young girl with his gun on her head.
HRITIM
Dekho mere haath me gun hai, aur
tum agar kuchh ulta seedha karogi
to mai maar doonga....
Tumhara naam kya hai
YOUNG LADY
Jaismine..
When you made a thumbs up toward
rohan , I saw you. From then I'm
following you. That flying camera
who's face is currently down was
sent by me. I was initially using
it to see the situation outside but
after that I used it for you. I had
to kill you myself.
HRITIM
You seems very angry of me... You
better do a favour to me. I'll take
out video recording and you'll do
nothing .
46.
Jaismine still had gun , she was trying to shoot in hritims
head, but he snatched it.
HRITIM
Mark my words. I don't want to harm
you but if you disturb, I will.
Suddenly robots were trying to break the door of control
room, and Rohan was still killing them from backside. Seeing
the situation Hritim suddenly connected his phone into
computer and started fetching video recordings.
Only two robots were left and rohan's bullet were finished.
He was gonna say "ecyon" by coming closer to the robot but a
voice from back side came speaking "stop". Rohan looked at
back and saw it was police . He was under arrest.
Meanwhile hritim was taking out video into his cellphone.
Police with arrested Rohan , saw that two robots were hitting
door to break, it. Police asked other one to bring sharad's
ID to open the door. Other police went to bring the Id of
sharab outside. Suddenly police heard two bullet shot in the
room. As soon as police opened the door they saw that both
robots were shot down mysteriously(by invisible gun in other
hand of hritim). A man with gun in one hand (taken off from
robots) came out with his gun pointing onto girls head.
Police started laughing as he was wearing the girls skirt on
his head and covered his face so others won't see his face.
Another police men lustfully, looking at backside of girl as
she was wear only panty. Rohan was still sad and looking down
and thinking about what happened i.e. Robots killed pregnant
woman.
A flashback scene explaining what happened inside. After
transferring data finished they were standing there, watching
CCTV footage of the situation outside the door. But when
police asked to bring sharad's id to open the control room
door
HRITIM (CONT'D)
Yaha par koi kapde hai kya, mujhe
muh dhakna hai.
JAISMINE
No, Agar hota bhi to mai nahi
batati.
47.
HRITIM
Apni skirt dogi kya , I'll wear it
on my mouth.
JAISMINE
What?? Nahi . Tum apna shirt utar
ke face dhak lo,
HRITIM
I have only vest inside me, My Arms
will be visible and policemen can
track me down using there cell
phone .
JAISMINE
To usi ko pahen lo na,
HRITIM
Ye , normal vest nahi hai, bullet
proof ceramics se bana bana hai, it
can't be molded. Ispe jab goli
lagti to to isme se blood ki tarah
paani nikalne lagta hai, which
Dodges the shooter like you had
done.
JAISMINE
Par vo saare camera's jo aisle me
lage, the, usme to tumhara photo
hoga hi na to face dhak ke kya
karoge, I will show everyone,
HRITIM
(moving his fingers)
I have shot them down, with my gun.
JAISMINE
Gun , kaun sa gun, tumhare paas to
koi gun nahi thi jab tum andar
aaye.
HRITIM
Chhodo, nikalo jaldi se skirt.
Hritim forcefully took out skirt. Hritim shot two bullets
with girls gun, to make 2 small hole for viewing through eye.
In CCTV, inside control room , it was seen by hritim that the
other police man was opening door. then
HRITIM (CONT'D)
Hritim put a gun in jasmine's head
.
48.
FLASHBACK OFF. CURRENT SCENE.
HRITIM
(deepening his voice)
Hands up please, I don't want any
turmoil here.
Hritim sees handcuffed brother and pretended that he don't
knew him. Rohan was looking down and he was pretty shocked
becuase of that death of pregnant girl . Hritim came out . He
left her outside and ran away from there.
Hritim came out and saw , the dead body of woman and hurted
sharad .
She was standing where hritim left her but after seeing the
pregnant woman dead body, she immidiately came toward her,
asking loudly what happened her.
All employees and passengers weren't saying anything as they
were also sad about the situation. (No one of them were
looking at her panty). Some of them were staring at
unconscious chief.
No employees said anything to police agains sharad as he was
reason they were earning. Passengers of airport didn't
understand the situation and thought Rohan randomly started
beating chief(sharad).
Rohan was taken to prison for his misdeed . Sharad was taken
to hospital.
Hritim was running away from airport. After going some far,
he wore the shirt inside out (still running) then stopped and
also did the same for pants. It changed the outfit of hritim
so that any satellite or any police gadget cannot track him
on using his clothing. All the blood-like water was sunked by
the vest in itself. He didn't used his car, as could be
tracked.
Police thought that it's rohan's car, and he came alone.
Hritim was running and after some time Ajit came to take him
using His highly advanced Bike.
Hritim went to ajit's home and tried to crack the encryption
using the hints given by Ajit. It took around 5 hours. Rohan
was in jail.
They started seeing the footage of that day. After some time
Hritim paused the video at a frame and was emotional as he
saw again his father , at the door of aeroplane entering into
the aeroplane and hritim was holding his fathers finger.
49.
AJIT
Why did you paused?
HRITIM
My father.
AJIT
Which one ,
HRITIM
(pointing with finger)
This is me and he is my father.
AJIT
It's like I've seen him somewhere?
HRITIM
You might have seen on airport,
when we had came.
AJIT
I wasn't there on that day. I was
at my home.
HRITIM
Oh.. So you may have seen him on
some hotels as his frequently moved
around.
AJIT
(confusingly)
May be.. Okay continue...
After some time seeing the picture , he continued the video
and saw a man jumping out to touch the aeroplane. It was
sharad.
AJIT (CONT'D)
What is he doing there
Hritim continued the video, after some time the man in video
knelt down and started searching something by touching the
ground . After sometime he molded his claw like he has caught
something on his palm.
AJIT (CONT'D)
Why is he molding his palm . Like
he is catching something in his
hand.
Sharad stood up and jumped forcefully to reach the bottom of
aeroplane . After touching it , he went from there.
50.
HRITIM
(murmering silently )
Oh , I see now, So he had used
invisible bomb to blast the
aeroplane.
AJIT
What happened here , why was he
doing excercise, there?
HRITIM
(breathing havily in
anger)
Hritim came out without saying anything to Ajit. He went
directly to meet his brother Rohan in prison.
Rohan inside the jail and Hritim outside it.
ROHAN
(still very depressed
mood)
Tum aaj hi bail karane chale aaye,
HRITIM
(slowly)
Mujhe ek raaj ka pata chala hai, jo
mai kisi ko bata nahi sakta .
(paused)
Sharad ne invisible bomb aeroplane
me lagaya tha, backside pe.
ROHAN
Abhi ke abhi mujhe bail dila, use
mai abhi ke abhi goli maar doonga.
HRITIM
Par vo usko paaya kaha se, I mean
vo technology to sirf mere pita
jante the na. Ho sakta hai mai hi
galat hu, ye technology mere papa
ne jisse bhi seekhi ho, usne sharad
ko diya ho .
ROHAN
But kyo?
HRITIM
Ye to sharad hi bata payega.
ROHAN
Chalo us kutte se milte hai, bahut
jyada hisaab baaki hai usse.
51.
HRITIM
Kaha hai, airport par?
ROHAN
Kahi hospital me pada hoga... Uski
acche se kutai ki thi
HRITIM
Par ,tum bahar kaise aoge
ROHAN
Bail lekar...
HRITIM
Abhi aaj dopahar ko hi tum andar
aaye ho, bail nahi milegi.
ROHAN
To tum airport jao, saare employees
se kaho ki Ham tumhare liye yaha
par SSC khol denge , par tumhe
sharad ki aur aaj ki saari sacchai
batani hogi court me.
HRITIM
Kaisi sacchai, tumne to sharad ko
distract karne ke liye peeta tha.
ROHAN
(emotionally and nodding
head)
Khud court me un womens ke dilo se
jab cheekh-cheekh sachhai niklegi
to sun lena.
Hritim went to air port , It was early night . Most of the
employees went to their home, but he found Jaismine was still
there on airport and crying. She was wearing skirt now of
different color that wasn't matching her cloth on chest.
HRITIM
Tum abhi yahi ho, ghar nahi gayi.
JAISMINE
(angry)
Tumne mujhe kyo chhod diya, mujhe
kyo nahi maara, Jab tum log ham
dono ko marne aaye the?
HRITIM
(confused)
Ham dono?
52.
JAISMINE
Mujhe aur meri bhabhi ko, tum logo
ne meri bhabhi ko to maar daala par
mujhe kyo chhod diya?
HRITIM
Ye aurat , tumhari bhabhi hai?
JAISMINE
Aur ab tum mujhe maarne aaye ho na?
To maaro mujhe, maar do. tum logo
ne chhoda hi kya hai ham dono ke
liye.
HRITIM
Dekho mere bhai ne is aurat ko nahi
maara, vo robot se emotional
miscalculation ho gaya tha, aur
unhone isko Goli maar diya.
JAISMINE
Accha to tum dono ne Suraj ko
milkar kyo maara tha.. Aur Rohan ne
Rofter Run Shine jo hamara tha,
uspe kyo attack kiya tha.
HRITIM
Suraj, kuan sooraj? Mere bhai ne us
mall ko khareeda tha.
JAISMINE
Firse jhoot, to mere bhai, aur
suraj ki maa ka khoon kisne kiya .
HRITIM
Dekho tum rohan par iljaam laga
rahi ho.
JAISMINE
Tum log ek haiwaan ho, sooraj ki
maa ne tum logo ko 2 roti kya diya
, tum logo ne uski saari vansh ko
hi naash kar diya.
HRITIM
(surprised)
Sooraj, you mean ...

JAISMINE

53.
HRITIM

HRITIM

JAISMINE
Jab tum log suraj ke ghar se bhaage

JAISMINE
Suraj's mom went to your room but

FLASH BACK
Suraj's sister was vomiting and jasmine was beside her.
Suraj's mom was very happy and she went herself to tell his
son-in-law about the pregnancy to the mall.
SURAJ'S SISTER
(to her mom)
Jab tum bataogi to mujhe unka
chehra dekhna hai.
When suraj's mom went to shop she started a live video to her
daughter . But she sees a man with cut on right hand and
immediately recognized him rohan. She sees that rohan was
planting a bomb and instead of showing her son-in-laws face ,
she put camera toward rohan . Jasmine and suraj's sister was
seeing this live . Rohan then came out immediately , and
suraj's mom came toward him in order to ask about her son.
55.
But all of sudden the mall fell down and Suraj's mom recorded
this .
ROHAN
(coming to suraj's mom and
emotional)
Mammi ji apko yaha nahi aana
chahiya tha.
Suraj's mom ran toward rohan and slapped rohan.
SURAJ'S MOM
Maine tumhara kya bigaada tha jo
tumne mere ghar ujaad diya. Tumne
mere bete fir mere damaad to kyo
maara.
ROHAN
(shocked and surprised
with tears in eyes)
Ye , ye tumhara mall tha... par ye

SURAJ'S MOM

Rohan immidiately came and tried to snatch the phone. In this
suraj's mom was fallen on a iron rod and it pinched in her
head .She was dead. Rohan threw phone and ran off.
Suraj's sister became unconscious seeing her husband dead
because he was inside the mall which fell. Jasmine was also
shocked.
FLASHBACK OFF. CURRENT SCENE.
Hritim , silently sat down on ground in deep grief. became
complete blind what do now. After some time he stood up ,
wipe out jasmine's tears.
HRITIM
(after some time)
I'm sorry , very very sorry.
As far as I know, Rohan didn't
killed Suraj. Vo khud bahut dukhi
tha.
After sometime ..Hritim called his fastcopter with his
cellphone at airport, after 5 minute , his fastcopter
arrived.
56.
HRITIM (CONT'D)
Chalo , baith jaao is, mai body to
rakh deta hu usme.
JAISMINE
Tumhe agar mujhe marna ho to yahi
maar do, Mujhe tum papiyo ke ghar
jaa ke marna nahi hai.
HRITIM
Yakeen maano , mai rohan ke baare
me aisa kuchh nahi janta tha. Mai
apne ghar nahi tumhare ghar ja raha
hu.
JAISMINE
She sit down in fastcopter but she
didn't let Hritim to sit in
fastcopter.
Hritim didn't did anything. Jaismine ordered fastcopter to go
for her home?
We see jaismine doing cremation of her sister-in-law body.
Seeing the fire of her sister-in-law
JAISMINE (CONT'D)
(weeping and looking at
fire)
Mai kal uske ghar jaungi fastcopter
vapas karne, rohan ko jail se aane
tak intezaar karungi aur fir mai un
dono kameeno to ek saath goli maar
doongi aur fir mai khud suicide kar
loongi.
At early morning we, see jaismine going toward the home of
rohan. When she reaches at the home or rohan, she sees that
many men and women along with some child were standing and
asking for rohan. When they see Jaismine with rohan's
fastcopter . One women said,
WOMEN 1
Tum kitni saubhagya shaali ho jo
rohan jaisa tumko boyfriend mila.
Beta chhodna mat, bahut acche karmo
se aisa pati milta hai.
JAISMINE
(angry)
Mujhe ...
57.
WOMEN 2
Beta , ye dekho mera bachcha jinda
hai to sirf aur sirf iska shrey
rohan ko jaata hai. Paida hote hi
iski haalat bahot kharab thi,
doctor ne 17 lakh rupye maange the
operation ke liye, mere paas nahi
the rohon ne iska ilaj karwaya.
Mere saare pariwaar wale aaj usi
rofter wale SSC me kaam karte hai.
Aaj ham bahut khush hai. Rofter me
to sirf robots and machine kaam
karti thi.
MEN 1
Mujhe dar dar thokre khaata tha,
mujhe uske business kholne me madad
ki , aaj dekho mai ek achha
business man hu. Mai aaj is layak
hu , soch raha hu ek statue bana
deta hu apne shop ke saamne.
MEN 2
Rohan swayam gareebo ke liye
bhagwaan hai.
WOMEN 3
(to men2)
Par bhaiya, agar kisi ne jhoot
mooth se unka faida uthane ki
koshish ki , to vo chhodte nahi hai
usko. Ab Rofter mall ko hi lelo,
uske maalik ne unse jhoot bolkar 60
lakh rupye maang liye ki alton busy
bank ko dena hai, par usne diye
nahi aur illigal activities me
shamil ho gaye. Fir jo hua kisi se
chhupa nahi hai.
Jaismine was standing and hering all this but hearing the
women3 she was shocked . And asked to repeat again. She was
feeling ashamed of her self. And after few seconds Hritim
came out.
Crowd was asking why rohan is in jail. Hritim said He'll come
out.
Hritim called Jaisimine into his home. She came along with
tears in her eye and bit emotional.
58.
HRITIM
Dekho ,mujhe pata hai ki tum gun
leke aayi ho ham dono ko maarne ke
liye, par tumhe yakeen karna hoga
ki mujhe aisa kuchh nahi pata tha
ki rohan itna bura insaan nahi hai.
Yakeen mano ek baar vo aa jaye mai
usko khud tumhare samne maafi
maangne ki liye kahunga. Aur tum jo
kahogi vo mai usko force karunga
usko karne ke liye. Vo hopefully 5-
6 month me aa jayega prision se.
JAISMINE
(silent looking down)
(after some time)
Tum airport me kyo aaye the.
HRITIM
Ab uska koi matlab nahi.
JAISMINE
(Holding hand of hritim)
Why did you came on airport.
HRITIM
I just came to ask for some
testimony so that we can take...
JAISMINE
That dog.
HRITIM
Yeah, But Why are you saying that
to him. What has he done to you.
JAISMINE
You won't know what he did to us.
He was raping my sister when Rohan
tried to save my sister but robot
shot her. He does this to all of
us. Par tumhara kya bigada hai.
HRITIM
(shocked face)
Usne mere aur rohan ke parents ko
maara hai ek invisible weapon se.
Mere paas suboot hai par mere papa
ne kaha tha ki is technology ke
baare me jitna kam jaane utna hi
theek hai duniya ke liye. Us din
control room me maine un robots ko
isi invisible gun se maara tha.
59.
(paused)
Rohan ne mujhe kaha tha ki tum log
rohan ko chhuda sakti ho .
JAISMINE
I'll give testimony to court , just
tell me when to come. Lekin hamare
paas jo suboot hai usse sharad ko
jail bhi ho sakti hai.
HRITIM
(closing eye emotionally)
But why would you help.
Day after that, at morning Hritim came to jaismine and took
her to the court. There she gave testimony.
JAISMINE
(on court)
He rapes pathpro's employees
everyday. Yesterday he was trying
to rape my sister and when Rohan
stopped him , his robot tried to
kill him. In that turmoil, my
sister got killed.
AI JUDGE
Can you provide a proof.
JAISMINE
He had sex with raveena day before
yesterday. You can check her and
ask for her consent.
Court called raveena for confirmation and cross questioning.
She then afterward sent for sexual assault forensic exam.
Raveen initially hesitated but after seeing jaismine and
Rohan's brother , she was comfortable.
Court announced that Sharad is guilty and he should be in
jail as soon as possible, and rohan is innocent so he should
be released immediately.
When Rohan came out of jail, he saw a large men and women are
waiting for him to greet him. There also the jasmine and
raveena.
Hritim called Jaismine and left raveena standing where she
was.
Rohan and hritim went away with their car which was arrested
with Rohan on airport to there home.
60.
Hritim was angrily looking at Rohans face and given 2-3 slaps
without saying anything.
ROHAN
Hey, Maine us ladki ko nahi maara .
Usko to un kameene robots ne maara
hai. Ye ladki kaun hai
HRITIM
Saale tumko nahi pata ki ye kaun
hai , control room se baahar aate
huye tumne dekha nahi tha.
ROHAN
Mera sir neeche tha us bechari
pregnanat women ke baare me soch
raha tha.
HRITIM
Uski sister-in-law hai ye.
ROHAN
(afraid)
(looking at her face)
Dekho maine nahi maara , yakeen
karo mera
HRITIM
You killed her whole family as well
as suraj. He is suraj's brother in
law.
ROHAN
(emotional)
Believe me I haven't killed Suraj
and rest what I have done was
required for greater good.
Rohan was folding hand and was asking for pardon by touching
girls feet. She after some time ,she pardoned him.
HRITIM
Tumne maaf kyo kiya is kameene ko.
Abhi ghar chalne do mai isko bahut
peetunga. Maine hi isse bataya tha
quaking weapon aur bahot saare
weapon ke baare me , aur isne iska
ye upyog kiya.
Rohan and hritim along with jasmine went home. Rohon met with
crowd and entered inside room. Hritim took a belt and started
beating rohan running. Jasmine was smiling.
61.
HRITIM (CONT'D)
(toward jasmine)
Take this belt , beat him as much
as you can but please don't ask me
to shoot my brother.
JAISMINE
No, its fine . Rohan is very good
person. I am now going my home.
This time I ask a favour , If there
is any work in SSC , please give me
one. I have no source to earn.
ROHAN
You can handle the SSC which was
yours.
JAISMINE
(smiling)
Thank you.
Hritim now its the time, we have to catch Sharad because
police will probably catch him because of accuse that we made
in court. And we have to do it before them.
Hritim using his smart devices , tracked out the details of
every possible hospital and found the hospital where he was
admitted.
HRITIM
Mil gaya.
ROHAN
Kaha chhupa hai
HRITIM
Dr. Sara intelli-health center pe.
Bed number 132-02
ROHAN
Hmmn. So he's on 132th floor.
HRITIM
Hmmn,
Is baar hamare paas time nahi hai,
aur is baar video nahi body gayab
karni hai.
ROHAN
Plan kya hai.
HRITIM
Let me see the inner view of
hospital.
62.
Hritim opens his cellphone and created a 3d view of hospital
popping out of screen. They both were learning the routes and
architecuture of hospital.
ROHAN
Plan? Plan?
HRITIM
Sochne de bhai??
Hritim paused few seconds and come up with a plan.
HRITIM (CONT'D)
I have one, plan.
ROHAN
Tha to socha kyo?
HRITIM
I am an SSI agent. Mai kisi chief
minster tak ko jail me daal sakta
hu bina kisi proof ke , short term
ke liye.
ROHAN
To Abtak, Sarad bahar kyo ghoom
raha hai, andar kyo nahi hai,
HRITIM
Abhi usko andar nahi karna hai...
vaise bhi Bina proof ke vo 2-4 din
hi andar rahega. Vaise bhi mujhe to
vo shuru me accha aadmi laga tha.
(paused)
Us din jab ajit uske baare me
office me patni ke liye operation
wali baat bata raha tha, to mujhe
laga , apni biwi ka bahut khyaal
rakhta hoga.
ROHAN
To kiske liye maang raha tha vo
paisa,
HRITIM
Apni biwi ki ek kidney bech diya
tha chupke se behosh karwake,
usne... sirf paiso ke liye taaki
aiyaashi kar sake,
(paused)
(MORE)
63.
HRITIM (CONT'D)
Aur sahi se ilaj nahi karwaya
kidney nikalwane ke baad to cancer
ho gaya usi se karan, fir us din
ajit se paise maangne aaya tha
taaki aur paise le sake .
ROHAN
Uski patni ka kya hua,
HRITIM
Marne diya, fir marne ke baad jo
bhi organ bikte hai jaise Cornea,
bech diya saale ne.
ROHAN
Oh to isiliye , ajit usko paise
nahi de raha tha. Mujhe laga ajith
ko de dena chahiye tha.
HRITIM
Khair plan pe aate hai,
To mai SSI kar id card leke andar
ghus jaunga hospital me ,
ROHAN
Ek second, us din Airport me jaach
padtaal ke bahane , tu andar kyo
nahi gaya. SSI ji.
HRITIM
Tumko kya laga, maine try nahi kiya
tha ....
Jaise hi ajit ke ghar se wapis aaye
the, mai uske kal hi airport gaya
tha.
Flashback at airport ....
Hritim is going inside the room of sharad. He sees Raveena
coming out from her room. Her face was red and she was
stretching her half top downside with her hand . Hritim
knocked the door and after about 2 minute , he opened the
door (inside he was wearing his cloth).
HRITIM (CONT'D)
(very confident which
showing ID card)
SSI..., we have to check your
airport, we have some Doubt about
this Airport.
SHARAD
Security ,just throw this motherfu*ker out.
64.
Two robots came toward and took literally threw him outside
the door and sharad closed the door.
Standing up , he called to ajit.
AJIT
Yeah, it won't work as the airport
now comes under Alton noyce after I
had sold them my shares and alton
ki saari companiya, franchise ya
uska kuchh bhi Indian sarkaar ke
control me nahi aati.
HRITIM
(confused)
Kyo.. Par Alton to Indian company
hai na .
AJIT
Ha , ...
FLASHBACK OFF. CURRENT SCENE.
HRITIM
Bas kar... mere dhulayi pe kitna
hase ga, 2 minute ho gaye tujhe
haste haste , kuchh sun bhi raha
hai mai kya bol raha hu, bahut
important hai jo mai bolne ja raha
hu..
ROHAN
(laughing)
Bas mujhe vo situation yaad karke
hasi aa rahi ,
(again laughing loudly and
trying to mimic Hritim by
putting his hand front)
SSI....
(again laugh)
HRITIM
Accha chal, planning batata hu,
warna police sharad ko utha le
jayegi aur tum haste hi rah jaoge.
ROHAN
(trying to stop laugh)
Achcha bata ,plan bata, kya hai?
HRITIM
Kuchh nahi bas tujhe mere saath
chalna hai.
65.
They reached at hospital, they parked their car. They walked
out to enter the hospital. They reached for entrance check .
They were clear from it.
ROHAN
(sliently)
Didn't you brought, your invisible
gun.
HRITIM
Brought.
ROHAN
That checker didn't caught it.
HRITIM
It's not made of metal and do not
radiate IR .
ROHAN
Oh.
They have to go for ticket claim ,which will let them enter
into the hospital. They saw that an AI was providing ticket.
AI TICKET PROVIDER
Please tell me the reason
HRITIM
(Looking at rohan, and bit
smiling and again said
overconfidently)
(showing SSI id card)
SSI, I am here to check for a
terrorist .
Rohon was smiling at hritim?
AI TICKET PROVIDER
Should I declare emergency, Sir?
HRITIM
Na, na , uske paas koi weapon nahi
hai.
AI TICKET PROVIDER
Okay go on?
HRITIM
Thank you.
ROHAN
(tapping on the back)
That's my boy, SSI Hritim.
66.
They went for the lift, It wasn't like of conventional lift,
instead it flies vertically upward and downward.
They took the lift and went for floor 132 , but as there were
exiting from lift1 , its left has lift2 where a man with lots
of bandages on this head and mouth was entering the lift2.
When they come to bed , they found that sharad was not there.
Then we see that the man entering into lift2 was sharad. He
somehow came to know that he was under arrest he was running
away.
Rohan and hritim tried to find him, but got no clues from
nurses and other patient . We see at ground floor that when
lift2 door opened and sharad came out 2-3 step, he saw the
police . He reentered to the lift2 and when lift2 was about
to close , police men saw his face. He then suddenly ran
toward that lift2 but it got closed. After few seconds we saw
that hritim and rohan came down.
HRITIM
Abe police, police
ROHAN
Vo to hamare taraf aa raha hai ,
mujhe dekh lenge to unhe shak hoga
HRITIM
Mujhe shakal se nahi pahchanta ,
tujhe janta hai , to muh peechhe
kar le.
Policeman came into the lift1 and saw a man face behind.
They cannot ran away as police will see rohan.
POLICE
Who are you? Why're you hiding your
face.
HRITIM
(trying to distract )
Why you are here? Did you
encountred someone.
POLICE
Tumse kya matlab be. Apna kaam kar.
Lift was fast enough to let them reach at last floor. Hritim
symbolized that you be here.
HRITIM
I'll go out with him . Any clue
from him will help us to catch
sharad.
67.
Police and hritim came out of lift1 . Rohan still being
there. He went little far from police but still following
policemen.
POLICE
(on a call)
Sir, I need access to camera's so
that I can search sharad.
VOICE FROM CALL
Done.
Policeman take sometime to search it after that he went to
wait for lift to go down. Hritim also followed him.
POLICE
(typing floor number for
destination floor)
Tum fir aa gaye.
HRITIM
Nahi sir vo mai piccli baar aa....
He was speaking then lift stopped at floor 96 . Policeman
exited but he continued to go down otherwise police will
doubt him .
He them sent message to rohan, that he is on floor 96. Rohan
immediately went there again running on stairs as lift was
busy . While running , rohan ordered on his mobile phone that
come at floor 96. After that Rohan entered into a floor 90,
and came out with patient cloth and doctors head mask. While
running he wore that cloth and when he was about to enter at
room 96, he wore head mask so was unidentified.
When Rohan reached there he saw that policeman already has
handcuffed sharad. He was in half dress of a patient and half
dress of doctor. So ,he immediately got attention of many
members. Some nurses even were smiling at him. Major of them
were robot, trained only for medicinal purpose.
ROHAN
(goinng toward police)
Hey, mere patient ko chhodo.
POLICE
Chinta karne ki koi baat nahi , ye
bilkul theek hai.
ROHAN
Aap is tarah se use nahi le ja
sakte.
68.
POLICE
I have orders.
ROHAN
To ruko mai extra patti khol deta
hu face ka.
POLICE
Okay theek hai. Jaldi karo.
Everybody was looking at him. Rohan took out a cutting gadget
from a medical robot doing operation. And hitted near his
ear. The police was unconscious. Every nurses were in fear,
and many patient who were able ,ran off seeing this .
He then tried to open the handcuff but it was trivial key
based . Being advanced , only policemen could open it. So
with that cutting gadget of operation on his hand, he cut out
sharads hand so that his body was out of hand. Sharad
shouting loudly. Rohan went on and closed hospital door.
ROHAN
Don't shout. Don't shout. I won't
kill you. Your life for me worths
more than your life necessary.
Rohan took a cloth from a bed and fastened tightly so that
some of the blood may not come out.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
(to robot)
Give me any pill or inject for
blood clotting.. fast fast.
Robot give him an injection , which he gave to the sharad
torturing him.
then he saw that his auto piloted fastcopter came up from
below to one of the glass window. Rohan threw sharad toward
the glass so that glass would break but it didn't and sharad
screamed
SHARAD
Ehhh, oooh
So after that ,rohan took up a medical robot (made of
ceramics and iron) and threw it toward the window, then glass
window broke. And threw sharad onto fastcopter and he jumped
into it himself.
Then after sometime , the policeman came to conscious and
due to (thap thap) voice of door , he opened the door. But
everyone except Hritim became afraid and some of them ran
away.
69.
It was because there was a cut of hand hanging with hadcuff.
Policeman hadn't seen it until then. after some time he
looked at his hand and in hurry send message to his
department that He need help
POLICEMAN
I need air -backup, unke paas
fastcopter hai.
Policeman opened the handcuff and throws down the ground to
pursue rohan's fastcopter. Both Police came down, sat into
car and ran after the the fastcopter . Fastcopter was around
500 meter from ground.
A call came in hritims mobile phone. He pick up and found
that it was from SSI officials.
SSI PERSONNEL
Hritim, you're mobile phone's all
system has been jammed . My voice
is bit over pitched and we are in
secure connection so that you
cannot be tracked .
HRITIM
Yeah, who are you?
SSI PERSONNEL
You were supposed to reach at the
destination yesterday. But You
haven't yet.
HRITIM
Which destination? Where
SSI PERSONNEL
Haven't you read the mail that we
send 7 days before. We're from SSI
from SSI office.
HRITIM
(mouth opened for
sometime)
No , I'm really sorry, sir. I was
bit busy with my family. Sorry sir,
SSI PERSONNEL
You've to reach our office till
tomarrow . You're already late. You
know our work doesn't allow latency
and secrecy. Right?
70.
HRITIM
Yes ,sir . I really didn't read the
mail. I will reach tomarrow.
The phone was then cut. Hritim opened the mail and saw the
mail. It was joining letter.
Meanwhile, fastcopter scene with rohan and sharad. Sharad was
crying out loud due to injury.
ROHAN
Tu chilla, jitna tu chillayega utne
mere dil to tasalli milegi. Tumse
bahut hisaab barabar karna hai.
SHARAD
Tum mujhe marte kyo nahi.
ROHAN
Mere sawalo ka jawab kaun dega.
Rohan saw that a fast moving flying object coming toward him.
It was flying-machine of policemen.
Rohan was looking at the flying-machine and he saw , bullet
like object coming toward his fastcopter. Rohan immediately
wore the doctor's helmet/mask again so that policemen won't
see him. The object pinched into the fastcopter , it stopped
the fastcopter and fastcopter was falling down side. The
after some time, The police in flying-machine shot down his
object so that again fastcopter may start(the police wanted
to catch him, not kill them). Now fastcopter was at height
around 100 meter.
Sharad then saw that the same policeman (from hospital) with
his car beneath him. The policeman in car tookout a weapon
out of his car and shot toward the fastcopter since it was
only 100 meter up. The policeman in flying-machine was just
watching it. After shooting from weapon , it spilled out some
rope like structure with rotating wing at the top(which
provides upthrust to the rope) . Sharad was bit afraid and
said no , no ,no . He accelerated the fastcopter and the rope
didn't catch the fastcopter . But the police reached at the
top at the required height of 100meter. The as he goes up,
the rope size squeezes and come into the weapon. When he was
at air(100m) he shot horizontally toward the fastcopter from
backside. Rohan thought he was rescued but the police entered
into the fastcopter.
There was a hand to hand fight between both of them. Police
said him to stop and show his face. Rohan continued to fight.
Rohan snatched away that rope weapon from policeman . Sharad
cannot do something as he was hurt too much. But he wanted
that policeman should win.
71.
After some time, rohan threw policeman out, the rohan came at
the door of fastcopter holding side handle with his hand. The
flying-machine of other police is up(500m from ground), but
looking at the falling policeman. After some time, rohan
shoot the weapon downward toward the falling man, the
weapon's mouth this time, converted into fastening rope like
structure and rohan saved policeman. The after few second,
sharad pushed rohan out by hitting at his head, on hitting
,the mask fell off and policeman on rope saw his face. The
police was looking at Rohan ,with surprised face.
POLICEMAN
(looking at rohan)
Nice to see you , Rohan..
ROHAN
Bad to see me.
Rohan then left the rope weapon and policemen in rope fell
down along with weapon . The Policeman in flying-machine
immediately came to save falling policeman. But he was dead.
The policeman in flying-machien then angrily followed Rohan's
fastcopter. There is heavy gun fight between them in air .
After sometime , Rohan ordered his fastcopter to shot him
down. A missile came out from fastcopter from backside and
shotdown the police flying-machine.
Rohan sat down on seat and was silent , it was face like he
was in remorse of killing the policeman.
After some time, he started beating Sharad but in control
because of his reason, the policemen were dead.
SHARAD
(trying to distract rohan)
Tumne , mujhse kuchh sawal poocha
tha
Rohan stopped beating him.
ROHAN
Tumne , aaj se 10 saal pahle ,
aeroplane me kya lagaya tha, jisse
aeroplane ka accident hua tha.
SHARAD
(laughing)
Kaun sa aeroplane .. maine kuchh
nahi lagaya tha..
72.
ROHAN
Chal theek hai, maan leta hu. Par
tum control office me kaam karte
karte airport ka chief kaise ban
gaye.
SHARAD
Ajit ko jail ho gaya tha, to mujhe
banna pada.
ROHAN
Kisne banaya, sarkaar ne...
SHARAD
(laughing in pain)
Government? kaun si government..
ROHAN
Accha chal bata , tumhare airport
pe saari ladkiya , chhoti kapde kyo
pahenti hai.... aur usme male kaam
kyo nahi karte.
SHARAD
(laughing and saying)
22wi sadi hai, modern jamana hai ,
ladkiyo ka jamana hai
Rohan pressed on the cut of sharad's hand. Sharad screaming
loud..
ROHAN
tu saara bakega , ghar to pahuchne
de.
Sharad' taking out mobile phone to call someone.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Ummhak, ruk ruk , tera yaha koi
madad nahi karne wala,
Rohan snatched the phone and threw it from away from
fastcopter.
The camera shot is following the fall of phone, A great view
of city is shown in between.
After the scene, Rohan brought sharad sliding on the ground ,
stair into a room. He was torturing him , remebering some of
the flashbacks like that of death of pregnant woman. He
wasn't asking anything for now, just torturing him. Rohan ,in
anger tortured him so much that he even cannot speak.
73.
After around 4 hours, Hritim came at home. He looks like he
was in hurry.
HRITIM
(scolding)
Tumne police ko kya maara.
ROHAN
Kyoki mere paas koi aur, option
nahi tha.
There was bit fight between this for this matter between both
brothers.
HRITIM
Mujhe SSI ke liye jana hai,
ROHAN
Tu mujhse door jaana chahta hai....
Hritim has a small tears in his face but said nothing
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Kab?? Ja raha hai
HRITIM
Aaj abhi ,
ROHAN
(Surprised)
Aur aayega kab
HRITIM
Pata nahi.. , kam se kam 5 saal
baad.
ROHAN
Itna bada life ka decision , itni
jaldi. Dekh mai police ko nahi
maarna chahta tha , par situation
aisi bani ki maarna pada.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
Tu mat ja, SSI ke bina bhi ham SSC
se gareeebo ka madad kar sakte hai.
HRITIM
(shouting loud angrily)
I'll go.
Rohan looking at hritim carefully . and after some time..
74.
ROHAN
(breathing )
Dekh mai tujhe rokunga nahi, par
kal chala ja na.. .. Achha tu ja
kaha raha hai?
HRITIM
Tumse matlab? Mujhe nahi pata.
Secret hai
ROHAN
(very emotional)
Kya matlab hai sab kuchh secret
hai, phone pe baat to hogi na.
HRITIM
(low voice and looking
down)
Hmmn..
ROHAN
To aaj nahi kal to tu bata hi dega.
Mai kah raha hu aj nahi kal chala
ja...
HRITIM
Nahi , mai aaj hi jaunga.
ROHAN
Accha chal, tujhe apne mehmaan se
milata hu.
Hritim came to see, sharad. He sees that sharad cannot even
speak . Sharad is staring at hritim as new saw him completely
first time.
HRITIM
Isko , itna torture kyo kiya, ab
jawab kaise dega tumhare sawalo ka.
ROHAN
Isko to mai , dawa khilwa khilwa ke
maroonga.
HRITIM
Do whatever you like... Tumne
fastcopter ko destroy kiya na.
Rohan open his phone and triggered self destroy button. We
see that fastcopter was blasted and destroyed because it
could have been tracked out by police.
75.
After sometime , Hritim was ready to go. It was the last meet
b/w them. Rohan was emotional but Hritim was very angry with
his brothers deed.
ROHAN
call pe and V-MEET pe baat karte
rahna.
Hritim said nothing and left .
Rohan came to hug to hritim but he went straight without
looking rohan.
After some travelling scene with electronic vehicles, there
come some pretty advanced car like vehicle. Hritim sat in it.
After sitting he heard voice saying "welcome my collegue".
It automatically went away at very fast speed.
Night passed away . On tomarrow morning, rohan brought some
food and water along with an metal rod.
He tortured too much , as after some time doing it , sharad
agreed to tell him something.
SHARAD
Tum mujhe jaane doge na,
ROHAN
Don't worry , you'll get to choose
your life on second deal. This is
first one, Whose compensation is to
hurt you. If you won't tell truth ,
I'll hurt you .
SHARAD
Please let me have ,water.
ROHAN
Chot jyada lagi hai, jyada paani
nuksaan karega, kal se nahi piya
hai, to le thoda sa pee le.
Sharad took a time to start his back stories... after few
seconds he started telling.
SHARAD
Ye sab kiya dharaya Alton ke
business men ka hai na.
ROHAN
Ye Alton company ka headquarter
kaha hai? They have lots of debt to
pay on us. Haa..
(MORE)
76.
ROHAN (CONT'D)
(paused)
maine ek baar Internet pe search
kiya tha alton ke baare me janne ke
liye, par india ke map pe kahi
dikha nahi raha tha.
Pata nahi kyo.
Fir maine , search engine pe search
kiya , saala ads de raha tha, alton
noyce canvas, alton noyce Intel
etc.... fir neeche jab link khola
to lamba sa alton ke saare brands
ke baare me bataya tha.
I hate it, I just can't read about
this company...
A laughing sound came while rohan was speaking
SHARAD
(while laughing)
Company , company....
(paused)
vo apne aap me poori duniya hai.
Aisa maan kar chalo , vo India ka
part nahi ,India uska part hai.
(smiling)
India'n government do what they
want. Indian government ek puppet
hai bas.
Tumko yaad hai, ajit ke 2 month ka
saja 10 saal tak kyo chala aur
mujhe airport ka chief kisne
banaya. Because they wanted it.
SHARAD (CONT'D)
Us din hospital me police mujhe
pakadne nahi , mujhe underground
karane aai thi. Aur us din Ajit
kadecryption key jante ho kisne
change modify kiya tha.
ROHAN
I don't care for now, but who?
SHARAD
AI judges ne change kiya tha.
FLASH BACK
We see that when phone was asked by AI judge. It goes to AI
judge for checking . Instead of checking, he changed the
password and said that it was modified by AJIT .
77.
FLASHBACK OFF. CURRENT SCENE.
SHARAD
It's because the judge was
commanded by government to do so.
Rohan in anger and hurry hit at his cut portion of hand and
asked
ROHAN
(shouting)
What the f*ck is this Alton.
SHARAD
India 2050 tak poori duniya ka
sabse aamir desh ban gaya tha.
China doosra tha, aur aaj bhi hai.
Par China ki working population
itni kam ho gayi thi ki waha ka
economy itna jyada growth dikha
nahi paaya.
India was developing fast , I mean
very fast. Koi job ki kami nahi ho
raha tha, to India ke talents US
bhi jaana band kar diye. To US bhi
itna growth nahi kar paaya.
But india's fast growing population
and industrialization wasn't
sustainable. But in late 60's
Indian scientist invented secretly
a gadget that searches Petroleum
beneath the ocean and in land
automatically.
Now All world was shifting toward
sustainable development and green
energy, But because India was
shifted to a capitalist country, it
became very rich country and they
don't want to buy other countries
batteries and other green product.
India instead of shifting to green
energy vechicles and gadgets , it
used conventional fuel . The
petroleum was so cheap that nobody
even tried to use other options.
ROHAN
Ye petrol kya hota hai, kabhi suna
nahi..
Drank remaining water....
78.
SHARAD
Since india has many job
opportunities and a democracy so
foreign migration , birth rate was
3 time that of mortal rate, use of
petroleum lead to global warming
and population explosion and
inconsistent rainfall.
The coastal and important region
for Indian GDP had been drowned
like mumbai and tamil nadu.
ROHAN
(angrily)
I didn't asked history, alton kaha
hai.
SHARAD
Late 90's me sabka side effect
dikhne laga tha. Due to this, India
saw huge deprecation in its economy
and GDP. Worlds were making fun of
India.
Tab kuchh architect ne Alton ka
design taiyaar kiya tha. They
created a huge very advanced
structure inside indian ocean.
ROHAN
What! , ye alton ek megastructure
hai.
SHARAD
Yeah,
"Advanced Life-supporting
Technology and Oceanic Nexus"
ROHAN
But why its so rich.
SHARAD
It looks like a heaven. Aur kaun
waha pe nahi jaana chahega. After
the alton was made , it was
attractive place . Most of the
Indian top rich personality went
there. Tum jante hi ho, 98% of
money in India is shared in only 5%
rich persons. And almost 90% of
rich persons came to Alton . Is
tarah se india ek duniya ke liye
rich country hone ke baawjood bhi
ek gareeb desh hai.
79.
SHARAD (CONT'D)
Give me your phone , I'll show you
some satellite images and pictures.
Rohan give his phone and connected to his big home theatre
for seeing visuals.
ROHAN
But when I searched, it only shows
its brands and companies and never
talked about the Alton itself.
SHARAD
Yeah, We have to use VPN for other
countries which are rivals of
India. Any content,book or news is
banned in India and it's ally
countries due to security reasons.
They don't want us to know about
their working. Isiliye koi job ,
jaise SSI , CCP jo alton me
execute kiya jaata , secret rakha
jata hai.
ROHAN
(hand was trembling)
He immeditately tried to call his
brother but found that he was
unreachable.
Rohan came to knew that he won't be able to talk to Hritim.
The after Rohan's mobile got connected to home theatre (big
screen).
SHARAD
Ab chalo alton ke baare me batata
hu,
to vo megastructure , Indian ocean
me banaya gaya hai. There goes a
road from mumbai jo ki ab doob
chuka hai.
The scene was shown into big screen . (The tv then zoomed out
for whole scene) and we see a very adavanced kind of road
that is made inside water. We see Hritim with no any gadgets
(except his gun due to undetectable nature). He was entering
into that path with that car . A bit adventerous scene inside
the water shows on the screen. Road was very advanced and
high tech.
The camera then zoomed out showing large road inside water
and zoomed out to tv screen.
80.
(This way Hritim comes to about alton in his TV screen and we
audience explore the heaven , The Alton).
Sharad slide the screen and then we see a oval structure .
SHARAD (CONT'D)
This is the beauty in itself. A
haven. A home lucky Richs.
Again Tv screen zoomed in and we (audience) see the actual
Alton first time. I was much much advanced. Much more than
Indian smart city of that time.
Sharad again tells that this inwater pathway comes back at
tamil nadu,coast. Actually the path revolves round the alton.
Sharad pointed to a point and said it is the station and
screen flashes and we see Hritim coming out of altoncross(where the inwater path and alton merges).. amazed ,
just looking only at the beauty of station.
Sharad explains the working of alton .
SHARAD (CONT'D)
It is made of a ceramic which
adjusts its density, that's why it
does not sink . Any wave coming
toward it , gets converted into
energy. This makes alton stable.
Its inside around 3 KM from top and
around 100KM from mumbai coast to
nearest edge of alton.
ROHAN
What about , oxygen and other gases
.
SHARAD
Ha, they have designed a engine
which takes the ocean's water and
convert into H2 and O2 . H2 is
exported to other countries along
with its usage in alton as the only
source of energy. Waha par lagbhag
6 h2o2 engines hai par sirf 5 hi
chalti ha, 1 backup ke liye hai. Vo
jagah choose karna economical tha
kyoki , uske neeche geothermal
hotspot hai, and water there is
hot. They use this hotness to
hydrolyse h20 of ocean into h2 and
o2 for h2o2 engine.

81.
SHARAD (CONT'D)
Waha ka temperature constantly 20-
25 degree C ka rahta hai due to sea
breaze and it makes it preferable
choice for riches.
ROHAN
Aur garmi me,
SHARAD
Constant 20-25, no major climate
change inside.
ROHAN
what about light ?
Camera moves into Alton and we see artificial sun (rounded
bulb ), which lights up the alton.
SHARAD
Each of them mimics the real sun,
that is, fuses the hydrogen into
helium. Waha pe total 90 suns hai
is tarah ke.
ROHAN
Oh,
SHARAD
30 suns is at each level. Wait what
, what is this level.
ROHAN
Level???
SHARAD
Ha vo teen level ka banaya gaya
hai, each of them are equally
beautifully. The top, The middle
and The bottom. Har ek layer ka
depth 10 km hai.
(paused)
Ye sun , real sun ke timing ke
anusaar apni chamak badhata hai.
Like morning me thoda dim, hoga,
noon me maximum intensity rahega.
ROHAN
Sun ,glows yellow like earth or
white like that in real space.
SHARAD
Exactly like sun, and is of same
size as that of sun as seen from
earth.
82.
At alton-cross , After bit exploring by looking around opened
mouth ,Hritim fell down because someone colloided with him,
Hritim saw that some very high tech persons with lots of guns
and wearning mask were making terror and looting it. And
scene was cut.
ROHAN
Understood, ab saare mere questions
ka answer bata.
(paused)
mera question hai , tumne vo
invisible weapon kisse liya tha,
SHARAD
(bit shocked)
How did you know about it? Not much
knew about it.
ROHAN
Tu bas mere sawal ka jawab de,
sawal mat kar.
SHARAD
Main ek din, office me 5 lakh
rupye..
ROHAN
I know it, bahar jakar kya hua ye
batao...
SHARAD
To tum log ajit se mile ho?
ROHAN
Jawab bata...
FLASH BACK
Sharad's home scene where sharad was sleeping with his cancer
patient wife due to removed kidney . She wasn't able speak as
she was very serious but had tears in her eye. Its like she
was try to speak something. Sharad was naked only wearing his
underwear. The scene looks like he had sex with his wife.
This scene is from left position i.e. The side of his wife.
After few moment , sharad changed his sleeping position.
There was a call girl sleeping beside him, on the right
position. She was sleeping nude, her stomach downside .
After few moment (night scene), some person(very rich look)
and bit mature age, came into his house without knocking,
wearing alton noyce canvas brand cloth.
83.
RICH MAN
I don't have time, I am coming
directly to the point...
Then he point to the call girl and
his wife , said.. I want you alone.
SHARAD
(afraid and touching the
girl)
Go, go you go,
Call girl woke up and wore her bra and ran off. When he tried
to wake his wife, he found that she was dead.
SHARAD (CONT'D)
(after some time)
She's dead.
RICH MAN
Dead?? You're sleeping with a dead
body and a call girl.
SHARAD
She was alive, she had cancer.
RICH MAN
I know you ,
(deepening his voice)
Very much of you ,what have you
done to her.
SHARAD
(afraid)
I didn't do any thing to her.
RICH MAN
I don't care . You just have to do
a task , to be specific blast an
aeroplane.
SHARAD
I won't do any thing, no.. I will
no..
RICH MAN
You know, I can make you rich and
not only that, jo tumne apni patni
ka organ becha hai, mai sochu to
police se complain karke, tumhe
jail bhi bhej sakta hu.
SHARAD
Tumhe kaise pata ye sab..
84.
RICH MAN
Do you know, mai kaun hu, I am the
CEO of alton noyce air. Our parent
company alton noyce buys data like
CCTV recordings , any voice
recording and pretty much any data
from every shops and places.
All companies stores them and sell
us, we give them good price for
them.
(paused)
Aise hi nahi ,ham 68% world ka
share hold karte hai. We send
personalized clothing to each of
our franchise through AI so that
customer has no option rather than
to buy it. And pathpro is no
exception .
SHARAD
Par aeroplane ko blast kyo karwana
chahte ho.
AIR'S CEO
Pathpro Air is very cheap
Aeroplane. Majorly there are very
poor in India. To log alton noyce
air ke advanced flight se kam, aur
pathpro se jyadaa travel karte hai
and I don't like it. Poore alton
noyce company ke sirf AIR branch hi
Indian market ko pakad nahi paaya .
I have plan to mitigate it . And
you'll help.
SHARAD
What's I'll get.
AIR'S CEO
For your misdeed, I'll give 3% of
share in pathpro and make you cheaf
of current airport.
SHARAD
3% bas
AIR'S CEO
3% is very much, also you'll be a
elite member of Alton since you're
a partner of alton noyce company.
Sharad was happy and ready to do.
85.
FLASH BACK OFF
SHARAD
Tab usne task bataya ki tumko , mai
ek invisible weapon doonga jo ki ek
bomb hoga, and you've to put it at
aeroplane anywhere.
SHARAD (CONT'D)
Fir usne kaha , ki agar pilot call
kare to tumko call utha kar chhod
dena hai, taaki automatic resue
operation na chalu ho jaye.
Suddenly rohan caught the neck of sharad and pressed it hard.
SHARAD (CONT'D)
(wheezing)
Janna nahi chahoge ki aksar alton
wale aisa kyo karte hai,
Rohan controlled himself and removed the hand from neck.
ROHAN
Mere paas samay nahi hai, jaldi
batao.
SHARAD
Alton to technically bahut advanced
hai, par waha agriculture nahi ho
sakta. It's because of obvious
reasons.
SHARAD (CONT'D)
Ek-dedh centuries se nature ka
bahut depletion kiya gaya. And
India was worst in it. Pahle
mumbai, gujrat , chennai and many
important economic states hote the
India ke . Ek samay india ke paas
28 states then. Par kinaare wale
almost saare doob gaye. Ab sir
india ke paas sirf 22 states hi
bache hai . And ek alton bhi hai.
Kabhi andaman and nicobar bhi ek
island hota tha, par water level
due to global warming sinked it
all. Jaise jaise samudra ka paani
andar aata gaya , log India ke
center me aate gaye. Lekin ek samay
me india population se saturate ho
gaya. There was no place for crops
and other things. Tab jaake alton
ke idea to hakikat me badla gaya.
86.
SHARAD (CONT'D)
So there is a trade between Indian
land owners and peoples of alton.
There should be huge employement
due agriculture , kyoki land lords
to khut kheti karenge nahi. But
guess what, Technology doomed there
also and not a single opportunity
left for poors to work.
SHARAD (CONT'D)
Ab tum samajh gaye hoge ki kyo vo
log india me business badhne nahi
dete. Kyoki agar india me business
hone lagi to alton ke log India se
khane ka samaan to mangayenge par
India unke products nahi
khareedenge ye use karenge. So
alton will eventually fall . So
they take there business seriously
and go whatever extent they can go
to stop any business in india.
SHARAD (CONT'D)
Ab tum samajh gaye hoge ki pathpro
airport ko down kyo kiya gaya tha.
SHARAD (CONT'D)
Par mujhe abhi tak samajh me nahi
aaya ki us CEO ko itni jaldi kya
thi.
Maine usse kaha tha ki mai aram se
mauka dekh ke aeroplane pe vo
weapon laga doonga , par usne kaha
ki nahi , tumhe usi din aur usi
flight me lagani hai.
Back to alton , where we see that hritim is getting honour of
SSI agent with there senior. It was his first day. He was
very happy. He was remebering the time when his father hold
hritim's hand said,
FLASHBACK ON
HRITIM
(using mobile phone)
Papa , meri mammi kaha hai,
HRITIM'S FATHER
(emotional)
Beta. She is ......
(started weeping)
87.
HRITIM
(holding the hand of his
father )
Papa , aaj ke baad mai mummi ke
baare me nahi poochhunga.. Mai apko
dukh nahi pahuchaunga , Promise
HRITIM'S FATHER
(weeping )
Beta, I need you to be SSI agent. I
will help you as much as I can. I
will try to teach you all those
skills in advance and provide you
my best guidance .
Just remember, I need you to be SSI
agent for a reason. I'll tell it
that day when you'll be standing as
SSI in my front.
FLASH BACK OFF
HRITIM
(murmering and wiping his
tears)
Papa mai SSI ban gaya...
Scene cut, Back to rohan
Rohan pointing gun and asking
ROHAN
Mujhe apna share de do, I want to
be owner of that airport.
SHARAD
Hmmnh, that share is locked in my
name. Ye share non transferable
hote hai. In fact , agar mera koi
ladka hota , to usko bhi mera share
usko nahi milta .
ROHAN
Tu marna chahta hai kya??
SHARAD
Alton noyce ke CEO ko bewakoof
samjha hai kya. Even I wasn't
knowing while signing the deal. I
came to knew it recently .
(paused)
(MORE)
88.
SHARAD (CONT'D)
Usne mujhe 3% and chief isilye
banaya tha, kyoki 3% ke liye mai
pathpro me jimmedaari aur mehnat
set kaam karunga.
SHARAD (CONT'D)
to.... mujhe pata hai ki tumne meri
baato ko phone me record kiya hai,
khaas kar patni ka organ smuggle
karne wala. To tum mujhe jindgi
bhar jail bhejwa doge .
(paused)
Agar aisa karte ho to mai tujhe na
hi apni position doonga , aur na hi
share de paunga. You'll get
nothing.
ROHAN
How about killing you?
SHARAD
Saara share wapas alton noyce ke
paas chala jayega and pathpro will
be declared an Althon noyce AIR
company. And you hate it right?, as
far as I know.
ROHAN
To mere paas tune option hi nahi
chhoda, mai kya karu tumhara?
SHARAD
Agar tum mujhe chup chap aise hi
chhod doge to mai tumhe apna chief
ka position transfer kar doonga.
And you can be owner of pathpro
airport till I'll be alive. I
won't say anything about you to
police as you have my weakness and
neither would you.
Rohan with confused face turned backside and staring at home
theatre screen, shouted
F*ckkkk............. , THE ALTON
Interval
.......constructive critisism is appreciated.......
